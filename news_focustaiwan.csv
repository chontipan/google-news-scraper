3/2/2020,Taiwanese seeking jobs in Philippine gambling sector urged to be cautious,"Taipei, March 1 (CNA) The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) on Sunday advised Taiwanese applying for work in the Philippines gambling industry to exercise caution, saying many companies in that sector are operating outside the law.In a press release, the CIB said gambling in the Philippines is legal only within designated areas, and many companies running that kind of business do not have the required government permits.Many Taiwanese employees in illegal online gambling businesses in the Philippines become embroiled in disputes over pay and suffer physical abuse, while some are abducted and their families are asked to pay a ransom for their release, the CIB said.The CIB said that in the first two months of the year, its liaison officer in Manila, in cooperation with Philippine law enforcement, rescued three Taiwanese employees in the gambling business who had been abducted.The figures for such cases were 12 in 2019 and 11 in 2018, the CIB said, adding that in some cases, the Taiwanese employees had fallen victim to loan sharks.People, therefore, are warned to be cautious when seeking jobs in the gambling business in the Philippines, the CIB said, citing the recent case of a Taiwanese being allegedly abducted and beaten after he got into a dispute with the illegal gambling company at which he was employed.The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in the Philippines received a call from the Taiwanese employee, appealing for help and saying also that his salary was being withheld, according to the CIB.Potential Taiwanese employees should carefully check the background of gambling enterprises in the Philippines before accepting jobs and should make sure they understand the terms of the work contracts, the CIB said.Those who do accept jobs in the gambling industry should ensure that when they arrive in the Philippines, the company would process their work visas, permits and other required documents, the CID advised.(By Huang Li-yun and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003020003
3/2/2020,Taichung company reopens after 2-week closure due to COVID-19 scare,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) A woodworking company in Taichung resumed work Monday after a two-week shutdown that was spurred by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and death in the family of one of its employees.All 58 of the company's employees were sent on leave and instructed to remain in home quarantine from Feb. 17 to March 1.After the two week period, the employees all tested negative for the COVID-19, and the company was allowed to resume operations on Monday, the Taichung Health Bureau said.The shutdown was spurred by the infection and subsequent death of a 61-year old private driver, Taiwan's 19th coronavirus case and first death, who was a relative of one of the company's employees.Before the man died on Feb. 16, he had infected four relatives during a family gathering on Jan. 27 -- his mother, sister and brother, and the husband of his niece.The woodworking company in the city's Tanzi District said Monday that its premises have been thoroughly disinfected and its employees will receive full pay for the two weeks they were in home quarantine.Meanwhile, a food processing factory in Taichung, at which the sister of the 19th patient was employed, also resumed work on Monday but said some of its workers were still in home quarantine.(By Hao Hsueh-chin, Chao Li-yen, Su Mu-chun and Ko Lin) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003020004

3/4/2020,TSMC teams up with Broadcom in 5nm process development,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has joined forces with U.S.-based integrated circuit designer Broadcom Inc. in advanced 5 nanometer process development.In a statement released Tuesday, TSMC said it has teamed up with Broadcom to strengthen the Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) integrated circuit packaging platform that supports 5nm technology.According to TSMC, CoWoS provides best-in-breed performance and highest integration density for high performance computing applications, and the particular wafer level system integration platform offers a wide range of interposer sizes, a number of high bandwidth memory (HBM) cubes, and package sizes.The cooperation with Broadcom means TSMC will provide one-stop services from IC packaging to pure wafer foundry services to Broadcom, which has come on board with other foreign tech giants such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Huawei Technolgies Inc., to use the Taiwanese chipmaker's 5nm process technology.In addition to contract chip production, TSMC has started high-end IC packaging operations in a bid to provide its customers with a wide range of comprehensive services.The 7 nanometer process is the latest technology the chipmaker has begun mass producing, while the company is also developing the more sophisticated 5mn and 3mn processes.TSMC is scheduled to launch mass production of the 5nm process in the first half of this year. The 3nm process is expected to begin commercial production in 2022.Through its partnership with Broadcom, TSMC's next generation CoWoS packaging services provide bandwidth of up to 2.7 terabytes per second, which is 2.7 times faster than the CoWoS solution the chipmaker previously offered in 2016.TSMC said with higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the CoWoS solution jointly developed with Broadcom is well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as deep learning, workloads for 5G networking and power-efficient data centers.At an investor conference held in mid-January, TSMC said the company expects to benefit from solid demand for smartphones, high performance computer (HPC) devices, Internet of Things related applications and automotive electronics this year.Amid optimism over global demand, TSMC has devoted itself to high-end technology development, a move expected to boost its global competitive edge and sustain the company's lead over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., which has started advanced technology processes with an eye to gaining a larger share of the global market.For the development of its high-end processes, TSMC has said capital expenditure for 2020 is expected to range from US$15-16 billion, the highest level in the company's history.Currently, TSMC has more than 50 percent of the global pure wafer foundry market.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003040004

3/6/2020,Taiwan shares plunge on U.S. market volatility,"Taipei, March 6 (CNA) Taiwan shares moved sharply lower Friday morning after the U.S. markets plunged overnight on growing fears over the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States, dealers said.Investors scrambled to dump large cap stocks across the board, with the downturn led by tech heavyweights, such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, they said.As of 10:58 a.m., the benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) or the Taiex, had fallen 169.29 points, or 1.47 percent, to 11,345.53 on turnover of NT$85.07 billion (US$2.84 billion).""The market was battered by panic selling soon after it opened, as investors saw an almost 1,000 point dive on the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight,"" Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su said. The Dow plunged 3.58 percent Thursday.""Market sentiment here was moved by a soaring VIX on the U.S. markets as investors at home and abroad feared the COVID-19 spread in the U.S., the largest economy in the world, will further affect the global economy.""The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX), which is widely considered an ideal gauge of fear in the market, soared about 14 percent overnight.The spread of the COVID-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has undermined production in China and interrupted global supply chains. The contagion could also hurt private consumption in the U.S.Since the novel coronavirus first emerged at the end of December, more than 96,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with infections in more than 80 countries and territories and more than 3,300 deaths, the majority of which have been in China.""Such unfavorable circumstances are expected to pose threats to Taiwan's export-oriented economy,"" Su said.It was no surprise that Friday's selling in Taiwan focused on the bellwether electronics sector, which depends heavily on global demand, Su said.As of 10:58 a.m., TSMC had lost 2.01 percent to NT$316.50 with 25.07 million shares changing hands after its American depositary receipts (ADRs) lost 2.37 percent on U.S. markets overnight.Led by TSMC, the electronics sector was down 1.43 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index was down 1.76 percent.Also in the high tech sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had lost 1.93 percent to NT$81.10, while Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., was little changed at NT$4,600.00.Following a 1.45 percent fall in its ADRs overnight, integrated circuit packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. had lost 2.99 percent to NT$71.40, while IC designer MediaTek Inc. had lost 1.17 percent to NT$380.50.Selling was also seen among large cap old economy stocks with Formosa Plastics Corp. down 1.61 percent at NT$91.80 and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 2.15 percent at NT$68.20.In the financial sector, Fubon Financial Holding Co. had fallen 1.88 percent to NT$44.30, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. had lost 1.37 percent to NT$39.60.""The silver lining was that the magnitude of the fall in the local market was not as heavy as elsewhere in the world as the TWSE remained awash in liquidity and many investors appeared willing to park their money here,"" Su said.""I expect the Taiex will see strong support at around the 240-day moving average of 11,049 points,"" Su said.

3/13/2020,Stabilization fund ready to shore up equity market: MOF,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Finance Minister Su Jain-rong (蘇建榮) on Friday said the National Financial Stabilization Fund is ready to lend support to the local equity market and its committee could meet at anytime if necessary, amid global volatility spurred by escalating fears over the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 worldwide.At a news conference held at around 8:15 a.m., 45 minutes before the local equity market opened, Su urged investors to remain confident in Taiwan's economic fundamentals, saying the Ministry of Finance, the central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission will come up with measures to stabilize the stock market.Su made the comments as concerns over the spread of COVID-19 intensfied, sending ripples through global financial markets.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,352 points or almost 10 percent, the largest single session drop since Oct. 19, 1987, when the index shed 22.6 percent amid a global financial crisis, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index also dropped more than 9 percent even though the U.S. Federal Reserve took the unusual step of injecting funds into the market.Despite Su's remarks, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taiex still opened down 331.29 points at 10,091.03 and the weakness continued on panic-led selling across the board.Su said the stabilization fund is watching the local equity market closely and its committee could meet anytime, if necessary, and jump into the market to counter the impact of global volatility.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.The fund intervenes in the market when it receives authorization from the fund committee, which is currently managed by Vice Finance Minister Juan Ching-hwa (阮清華), who is executive secretary of the fund.However, Su said with the virus, originally from the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading worldwide, it is no surprise that the global economy faces severe challenges with plunging equity markets around the world.In addition to the dive on the U.S. markets, the equity markets in France, Germany and the United Kingdom also tumbled 12.28 percent, 12.24 percent and 10.87 percent, respectively, Thursday.Compared with the markets in the U.S. and Europe, Juan said, Taiwanese equities appear resilient despite the ongoing scare over the virus. He cited data from Feb. 24 to March 12, showing that the Taiex fell 10.82 percent, while the Dow dropped 26.88 percent, and the markets in France, Germany and the U.K. shed 32.93 percent, 32.54 percent and 29.26 percent, respectively.The relatively small drop in Taiwan came as the country has executed efficient and effective measures to contain the spread of the virus, Juan said, adding that healthy economic fundamentals and attractive dividend yields in the equity market have enabled Taiwanese stocks to fend off unfavorable external factors to some extent.""It is unnecessary for investors to panic,"" Juan said, ""They should have faith in the local equity market.""(By Wu Chia-jung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003130003

""The local equity market has been battered by external factors instead of fundamental problems for the moment and it is too early to say when the market will stage a meaningful technical rebound despite some bargain hunting.""Among the falling tech heavyweights, TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock on the local market, had shed 3.91 percent at NT$282.50 after hitting a low of NT$272.50, with 85.16 million shares changing hands.""I think TSMC and other large cap stocks have been supported by government-led funds in a bid to prevent the Taiex from falling further and to bolster market confidence,"" Tang said.The stabilization fund will enter the market only if the fund's committee meets and issues an order for intervention.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.Also in the electronics sector, which had fallen 5.38 percent as of 11:56 a.m., iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had shed 4.02 percent at NT$71.70, but came off a low of NT$69.90 on bargain hunting.When Hon Hai shares fell to NT$69.90, the stock's market cap fell below the NT$1 trillion level reaching NT$969 billion as investors took their cue from recent sell-offs of the stock by foreign institutional investors, which registered net sales of 88.26 million shares in the previous five sessions, dealers said.Terry Gou (郭台銘), founder of Hon Hai, told reporters on Thursday that progress in reopening the company's sprawling production sites in China after the Lunar New Year holiday is ahead of schedule.Hon Hai is one of the largest investors in China with a workforce of more than 1 million.Last week, Hon Hai Chairman Liu Young-way (劉揚偉) said production at the company's factories has met more than 50 percent of demand in the current quarter, a traditionally slow season for the electronics industry, since production resumed after the holiday.Bargain hunters also bought into integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc., which had lost 3.13 percent at NT$325.50 after hitting a low of NT$305.50, as of 11:56 a.m., while shares in Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc. had fallen 2.76 percent at NT$3,890.00, off an early low of NT$3,620.00.In the petrochemical sector, which was hit by falling international crude oil prices, down 7.48 percent, Formosa Plastics Corp. had lost 6.90 percent at NT$78.20, Nan Ya Plastics Corp. had fallen 7.99 percent to NT$58.70, and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. shed 8.82 percent at NT$70.30.""Unless the global virus contagion shows signs of easing, global volatility could continue and it is hard to say where the Taiex can find strong technical support anytime soon,"" Tang said.(By Chung Jung-feng, Pan Yi-ching and Frances Huang) Enditem",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003130006

3/28/2020,Extreme heavy rain alert issued for Taitung,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) An extreme heavy rain alert has been issued for Taitung County in southeastern Taiwan on Saturday due to the effects of a weather front, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).The CWB said precipitation on Orchid Island of Taitung is expected to become apparent and will continue into Saturday afternoon due to the weather front, warning people living in low-lying areas of floodwaters.The bureau has lifted a heavy rain warning it had previously imposed earlier Saturday for the areas south of Taoyuan City as the weather front is passing, but it warned of possible occasional heavy rainfall in northern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula in the south.Under the bureau's definition, heavy rain means accumulated rainfall of 80 millimeters or more within a 24-hour period or rainfall of 40 mm or more in an hour, while extreme heavy rain is defined as accumulated rainfall of 200 mm or more within 24 hours.Along with the rainfall brought by the weather front, an accelerating northeasterly wind system is expected to cool northern Taiwan down as temperature highs are forecast to fall to 21-24 degrees Celsius Saturday from about 30 degrees a day earlier.Daytime temperatures in central and southern Taiwan are expected to fall in a moderate pace to 27-28 and 29-30 degrees, respectively, on Saturday, from 31-32 degrees a day earlier, the CWB said.With the weather front intensifying, the CWB said, the mercury around Taiwan will fall further from Saturday night through early Sunday morning.The bureau forecast temperatures will dip to 15 degrees in northern Taiwan, 16-17 degrees in central Taiwan and 18-19 degrees in the south on Sunday.It urged the public to keep a close eye on a wide day-night temperature gap, in particular in central and southern Taiwan, and to stay warm.In addition, the CWB said, the wind system is also expected to bring in strong winds for the areas north of Tainan, eastern Taiwan including Orchid Island and Green Island, the Hengchun Peninsula, as well as the outlying Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands Saturday.Such low temperatures are expected to continue into Sunday but drier weather is likely, with only sporadic showers expected in northeastern Taiwan and the mountainous areas in the north, the CWB said.Meanwhile, air quality in the north as well as Yilan, Hualien and Taitung in eastern Taiwan and the outlying Matsu and Penghu islands were rated ""good"" on Saturday, while it was ""fair"" in central Taiwan, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south, as well as Kinmen, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said.(By Chen Chun-shuo and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003280001

3/28/2020,U.S. reportedly eyes curb of TSMC's supply to Huawei,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) The United States has been aiming to curb the supply of chips sold by contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to China's Huawei Technologies Co. through planned heavier sanctions against the Chinese telecom equipment giant, according to a Reuters report.The report said while tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating with both sides blaming each other for spreading the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Trump administration has a plan to introduce new measures to further restrict global chip sales to Huawei.Under the proposed new rules, the report, dated Thursday in Washington, said foreign companies that use U.S. production equipment to roll out their chips would be required to obtain a U.S. license ahead of sales of certain chips to Huawei, which was blacklisted last year.Citing unnamed sources, the report said the measures are aimed at curbing supplies of chips to Huawei's integrated circuit design subsidiary arm HiSilicon Technologies Co. from TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.The report said it remained unknown whether President Donald Trump will approve the new sanction measures since he appeared to oppose the measures in February. If the new measures are imposed, Huawei and TSMC, as well as American enterprises, will feel the pinch, it said.The report quoted a research paper written by China-based Everbright Securities last year as saying most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials.""This is going to have a far more negative impact on U.S. companies than it will on Huawei, because Huawei will develop their own supply chain,"" trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said in the report. ""Ultimately, Huawei will find alternatives.""In Taipei, TSMC said it was unable to respond to any ""hypothetical questions"" and would not comment on any individual clients.According to a market estimate, Huawei accounts for about 10 percent of TSMC's total sales. Market analysts said if the strict rules are imposed, TSMC will see its shipments squeezed.After the possible heavier sanctions against Huawei surfaced, shares of TSMC gave up earlier gains of 2.14 percent on the Friday trading session in Taipei, falling 2.50 percent to close at NT$273.00 (US$9.03) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index also came off an earlier high of 9,954.86 points, down 0.38 percent to end at 9,698.92.On Friday, foreign institutional investors sold a net 5.23 million TSMC shares, stopping a three-day streak of a net buy, but for the entire week, such investors recorded a net buy of 28.47 million TSMC shares.TSMC's American depositary receipts on the U.S. market also fell 5.94 percent overnight as the market came under pressure amid fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.(By Emmanuelle Tseng, Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003280003

3/31/2020,All 214 evacuees from Hubei placed in quarantine,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The 214 Taiwanese nationals who returned to Taiwan on Monday night after being stranded in Hubei province by the new coronavirus outbreak have been placed in quarantine and will soon be tested for COVID-19.The passengers were taken by about a dozen tour buses to an undisclosed quarantine venue in northern Taiwan at around 1 a.m. Tuesday after undergoing health screenings at the airport, and will be quarantined for 14 days.Military servicemen chemically disinfected the vehicles after the passengers reached the quarantine facility.All returnees will be tested for COVID-19 within 48 hours, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center.The handling of these Taiwanese who were stuck in Hubei province after it went into lockdown in late January to contain the spread of the new coronavirus has been controversial.They were all put on a list of people who required special permission to return to Taiwan, unlike other Taiwanese currently returning from areas where the virus seems much more active, such as the United States and Europe.Those on the list are being required to return on special pre-arranged flights, which the government is describing as ""charter-like flights,"" and then put in quarantine in government-run facilities after arriving home.People arriving from other parts of China or other parts of the world can take regularly scheduled commercial flights to Taiwan and self-quarantine at home for 14 days.The 214 Taiwanese had to make their way on their own from Hubei province to Shanghai's Pudong International Airport to catch the special flight operated by China Airlines, which departed at 8:02 p.m. Monday and arrived at Taoyuan International Airport at 9:38 p.m.It was the second of two special flights contracted by the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a semi-official agency that handles cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in the absence of formal bilateral ties, to bring home Taiwan citizens stuck in Hubei.The first was arranged late Sunday, when 153 Taiwanese returned home.These Taiwanese had been stranded in Hubei since late January but were able to leave the area after restrictions on the movement of people there were lifted on March 25.Many others are still stuck in Wuhan, but will be able to leave if restrictions there are lifted on April 8 as scheduled.(By Liu Chien Pang and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310002

However, it was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.It has not been a member of the United Nations or the WHO since then.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310005
3/31/2020,Hon Hai shares edge higher on 2019 results,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker that churns out many of Apple's iPhones, moved higher Tuesday morning after it reported an increase in earnings per share (EPS) for 2019, dealers said.The gains were limited, however, as investors were wary of a fall in Hon Hai's profit margins amid escalating competition in the global market and concerns over a possible delay in the launch of the next generation iPhones amid the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.As of 11:38 a.m., shares of Hon Hai had gained 0.29 percent to NT$70.20 (US$2.32), off a high of NT$70.50, on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index was up 1.13 percent at 9,738.67 following gains in the U.S. overnight.In a statement released Monday, Hon Hai said it posted net profit of NT$115.31 billion in 2019, down 10.65 percent from a year earlier, but its EPS of NT$8.32 beat its EPS of NT$8.03 in 2018.Analysts said the EPS growth largely resulted from Hon Hai's move to cut its capitalization by about 20 percent in 2018 to NT$138.63 billion to maintain its EPS above the NT$8 level.It was the first time the company had lowered its capital since it first listed publicly in June 1991.Though EPS rose in 2019, the company's lower gross margin and operating profit margin fell due to intensifying global competition, giving investors pause.The company had a gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- of 5.91 percent in 2019, down 0.36 percentage points from a year earlier, and its net margin -- the difference between its gross profit and its total expenses -- was down 0.29 percentage points to 2.15 percent in 2019.Its operating profit margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- was also down 0.42 percentage points to 2.15 percent.In addition to cutting its paid-in capital, Hon Hai was also able to maintain its EPS above NT$8 in 2019 because of efforts to automate its production, a fall in the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, and a sharp decline in the losses of subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd.The Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, in which Hon Hai holds a 62.8 percent stake, cut its net loss to US$12.29 million in 2019 from US$857.12 million a year earlier because of efforts to keep costs down.Hon Hai had consolidated sales of NT$5.34 trillion in 2019, the highest in the company's history, but they were only up 0.92 percent from a year earlier.Hon Hai said it has scheduled an annual general meeting for June 23.Analysts have estimated that Hon Hai's sales in the first quarter of 2020 will fall 40 percent from NT$1.74 trillion in the fourth quarter to below NT$1 trillion because of slow season effects and falling demand caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.(By Chung Jung-feng and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310006

""So, we are here today calling for the MOL to mandate that dormitories be located away from the workplace to save the lives of migrant workers and firefighters.""Prior to the Taoyuan fire earlier this month, six Vietnamese migrant workers in Taoyuan City died in December 2017 in a factory fire that engulfed their dormitory, which was on the upper level of a factory warehouse made of sheet iron. The structure belonged to Sican Co., which runs a factory that produces solar control window film.Four months later, a blaze at a facility operated by Chin Poon, a printed circuit board factory in Taoyuan, claimed the lives of two Thai workers who were trapped in a dormitory on the factory premises, while six firefighters died in the rescue efforts.""The firefighters rushed into the burning factory because it was their duty to save lives,"" Chu Chih-yu (朱智宇), secretary general of the National Association for Firefighters' Rights, said at Tuesday's rally. ""But if people didn't live inside the factory, then the firefighters would not have had to put their lives on the line and enter the burning building.""The migrant workers at the rally, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, along with Taiwanese supporters, shouted slogans and burned incense at a makeshift altar in memory of those who had perished in the factory fires.A Filipino, who asked to be identified only as Arturo, said when he was working at a factory in Taoyuan last year, he was housed in a dorm in the basement of the building with nine coworkers.""There was once an earthquake and we felt extremely scared because there was only one exit from the basement. Imagine a fire -- we all would have been trapped,"" said Arturo, whose right hand was severed in a factory accident last year.Another Philippine worker said, however, that work safety is not the sole responsibility of the employer, and there is no guarantee that factory employees will be safe even if their dorms are offsite.""I have seen workers cooking in their rooms when they are not supposed to, plugging as many as 10 power adaptors to one outlet in the wall, and bringing cellphones into the work area,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named.Common sense is what is most important when it comes to safety, she said, adding that she works with toxic, flammable and combustible materials on a daily basis.In response to the protesters' calls, Huang Wei-cheng (黃偉誠), a section chief at the MOL's Workforce Development Agency, said the ministry is planning to amend the law to make it mandatory for factories that have onsite dorms to file safety reports, which would include a declaration of any pyrophoric substances or flammable gases on the site.The legislation, which is expected to be completed by June, will also state how often safety checks will be carried out at factories, according to a statement issued later by the MOL.Hsu, however, expressed skepticism about such safety checks, saying that there are some 100,000 dormitories throughout Taiwan for migrant workers, while the number of inspectors responsible for checking on the welfare of the workers totals only 274.""Work safety and the general welfare checks are usually carried out once, when a migrant worker first arrives in Taiwan, due to a lack of manpower,"" Hsu said.Among the 719,847 migrant workers in Taiwan, 455,934 are employed in the industrial sector, according to MOL statistics valid as of the end of February.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310011

As a result, TSMC's market capitalization returned to the NT$7 trillion level at NT$7.1 trillion, up from Monday's NT$6.86 trillion.Led by TSMC, the bellwether electronics sector closed up 1.32 percent and the semiconductor sub-index ended up 1.72 percent.Despite the spike in the semiconductor sub-index, shares in integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. fell 2.67 percent to close at NT$327.50 amid worries over the lockdown in India, one of the Taiwanese firm's major markets, due to the virus contagion.Also in the electronics sector, PC brand Asustek Computer Inc. rose 5.96 percent to close at NT$204.50 on hopes that its notebook computer and tablet computer shipments will receive a boost with many companies worldwide asking employees to work from home.Meanwhile, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. bucked the upturn, coming off an early high to close down 0.14 percent at NT$69.60 after the company reported a day earlier a fall in its gross margins for 2019 in the wake of escalating global competition.""Despite the gains enjoyed by select large cap tech stocks, certain old economy and financial stocks came under pressure as investors remained bothered by further possible global volatility despite the Dow's latest upturn,"" Huang said.Shocked by a plunge in international crude oil prices, investors dumped petrochemical stocks with Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 1.62 percent to close at NT$54.70, Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. down 1.03 percent to end at NT$67.00, and Formosa Plastics Corp. down 0.13 percent to close at NT$75.10.However, Wei Chuan Foods Corp. soared 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$19.95 on the back of the company's relatively high dividend yield.In the financial sector, which ended down 0.54 percent with banks' interest spreads falling, Cathay Financial Holding Co. fell 1.40 percent to close at NT$35.30, and Fubon Financial Holding Co. dropped 0.92 percent to end at NT$37.55.""There are no signs the global virus spread will ease anytime soon so many investors remained reluctant to chase prices for the moment,"" Huang said.

3/31/2020,Bank heist suspect nabbed in Taoyuan,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A suspect who got away with NT$800,000 (US$26,429) after robbing a Bank of Panhsin branch in Taipei a day before was arrested in Taoyuan Tuesday.According to local police, the robber was caught at around 3 p.m. in front of a convenience store on Zhongxing Road in Longtang District.At the scene of the arrest, officers also found an assault rifle that he used to carry out the crime, as well as NT$600,000 in cash stashed in his car.Investigators are currently still questioning him as to his motive, including the whereabouts of the remaining missing money.The robbery took place early Monday, when he threatened two female bank clerks by firing five shots into the ceiling and ordering them to put the money into his green duffle bag.He also shot a security guard stationed at the bank in the leg.The robber then made off in a taxi that he stole outside the Zhishan MRT Station in Shilin prior to carrying out the heist.The vehicle was later found ditched on Wenhua Road in the Linkou area west of Taipei.Police immediately began looking for the suspect through surveillance cameras and finally tracked him down in Taoyuan City Tuesday.(By Huang Li-yun and Ko Lin) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310014
3/31/2020,Transgender activists release 7 policy demands,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Activists marked Tuesday's International Transgender Day of Visibility by announcing seven policy demands based on what they called the largest-ever survey of Taiwan's transgender community.At a press conference, the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) announced the results of the survey, which was open to respondents who identify as transgender under the broad definition of the term -- those whose gender identities or expressions differ from what is typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.The survey, which was conducted online March 14-25, received 518 valid responses, which served as the basis for the seven policy proposals, the TAPCPR said.The alliance's first two demands were to end the practice of requiring sex reassignment surgery for people seeking to change the gender designation on their national identification cards, as well as allowing coverage of elective sex reassignment surgeries under Taiwan's National Health Insurance program.According to a 2013 report on Taiwan's implementation of human rights by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the former requirement could constitute a form of torture, the group said.These concerns were further borne out in survey results, the TAPCPR said, in which 30.42 percent of the respondents said they were unsure about the safety of such surgeries, 29.54 percent doubted their necessity and 52.3 percent considered them prohibitively expensive.In its third and fourth demands, meanwhile, the group called for acceptance of the transgender community's collective diversity and for reforms of Taiwan's gender designation policies based on consultations with the transgender community.As an example of this diversity, the group cited survey results showing that 52 percent of the respondents identified as either male or female, while 48 percent identified themselves as nonbinary, gender-fluid or agender.Given the complexity of gender identity revealed in the survey results, the government should abandon the poorly received ""third gender policy"" it proposed in 2017, and instead should adopt new guidelines based on consultations with the transgender community, the alliance said.Fifth, the alliance called for an abolition of legal distinctions between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages.Because Taiwan's marriage equality law was passed as a special act rather than a revision of the Civil Code, which governs opposite-sex marriage, the legal rights enjoyed by the two forms of marriage vary, with a disproportionate impact on transgender individuals, the group said.For example, if a person married under the Civil Code seeks to change their gender designation and have their marriage recognized under the marriage equality act, they lose the right to adopt children as a couple and can only adopt their partner's biological children as a step-parent, the group said.On a broader social level, the alliance recommended starting gender identity education beginning in elementary school as a way of pre-empting the experience of the 47.68 percent of survey respondents who said they were bullied, discriminated against or otherwise mistreated at school.Similarly, the government should include transgender people in its monitoring of hate crimes, given that 37.3 percent of those surveyed said they had suffered workplace discrimination, the alliance said.Overall, the survey respondents reported suffering a wide range of social difficulties related to their gender identification.These included 55.41 percent who feared discrimination in public restrooms, 24.32 percent who delayed or avoided medical treatment and 22.01 percent who had been discriminated against while shopping for clothes or accessories.Another 18.53 percent said they had been sexually harassed or attacked in public, while 15.83 percent were afraid to call the police in an emergency, according to the survey results.(By Yang Su-min and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310015
3/31/2020,Constitutional Court hears debate on decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Grand justices heard arguments at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday on whether a criminal law that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after several judges asked for an interpretation of the law.Article 239 of Taiwan's Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.Eighteen judges and a male who was convicted of adultery have asked the Constitutional Court in recent years to overturn Interpretation 554, which determined that Article 239 was constitutional.The most recent one was a judge surnamed Chen (陳) from the Miaoli District Court who mainly hears cases related to ""offenses against marriage,"" who felt Article 239 may violate the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan).The court finally agreed to hear the case and heard arguments Tuesday, some of which centered around Interpretation 554.The interpretation, which was made in 2002, ruled that the freedom of sexual behavior is inseparably related to the personality of individuals, and every person is free to decide whether or not and with whom to have sexual affairs.Such freedom is, however, legally protected only if it is not detrimental to the social order or public interest as provided in Article 22 of the Constitution, and therefore the freedom of sexual behavior is subject to the restriction put on it by marriage and the family system, the ruling said.One of the judges arguing for decriminalization, Wu Chih-chiang (吳志強), said adultery is not the only factor that shakes a marriage and therefore there was no need to intervene with ""national punishment.""He argued that Article 239 could lead to unfairness and inequality in administering punishment, forcing people to maintain an unwanted marriage.Wu was referring to complaints by supporters of the decriminalization of adultery that under Article 239 the crime of adultery cannot be prosecuted without a complaint by the victim, and if one spouse withdraws charges against the other, the withdrawal does not apply to the outside party.That has led in practice to women likely to be pressured by their husbands to drop the charges against them during the proceedings, yet the cases against the mistresses go ahead.Judge Chang Yuan-sen (張淵森) argued that the purpose of criminalizing adultery was to protect the family and social morals and prevent people from suffering in a miserable marriage.Yet while the law gives people the ability to get married and divorced freely, it cannot use criminal law to ""threaten"" people into acting faithfully in a marriage, he contended.Many factors cause suffering in a marriage, including the relationship between the wife and her mother-in-law, child education problems, financial issues, and sexual relations, Chang said.""If one person suffers in a marriage, it does not mean the other party has to be punished. Suffering should not be a reason for punishment in the Criminal Code,"" he said.Chi Hui-jung (紀惠容), a former executive director of the Garden of Hope Foundation who attended the Constitutional Court as a friend of the court to present her opinions, called Article 239 a law that punishes women.Although there are more men charged for adultery than women, in the end more women, most of them the mistresses in the cases, are convicted, she said.At the same time, she argued, the crime of adultery uses the Criminal Code to deter people from having affairs, but in a society that now frowns on using corporal punishment to discipline children, it is inappropriate to use ""threats"" to keep marriages together.Deputy Minister of Justice Tsai Pi-chung (蔡碧仲) argued, however, that the criminalization of adultery is aimed at safeguarding the marriage and family system.To support her position, Tsai cited Interpretation No. 544, which says the root of the nation's marital system lies in the freedom of personality, with such social functions as the maintenance of the order of human relationships and gender equality, and the raising of children.To insure an enduring and unimpaired system of marriage, the state may of course enact relevant rules to require a husband and wife to be mutually bound to each other by the duty of faithfulness, the interpretation says.The freedoms of individuals should still be restricted by the need to maintain social order, Tsai argued, and therefore Article 239 is not unconstitutional.(By Lin Chang-shun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310016
3/31/2020,Prosecutors voice support for decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310017
3/31/2020,Taiwan further expands screening to curb COVID-19 pandemic,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Tuesday announced that it will expand the scope of COVID-19 coronavirus screening tests to all patients with pneumonia and those who have lost their sense of smell or taste, effective immediately.Henceforth, patients with such symptoms will be required to undergo coronavirus screening tests, said CECC expert Chang Shan-chwen (張上淳) during a news briefing.Chang said the CECC decided to expand screening to patients with pneumonia in the hope that doing so will make it easier to detect those infected with COVID-19 more quickly and before they infect others.The decision came after two of the most recent cases were individuals with no recent overseas travel history, who tested positive for coronavirus only after doctors sent their samples for screening following a pneumonia diagnosis, according to the CECC.As of Monday, 24 of the more than 300 confirmed cases in Taiwan were found to have lost their sense of smell or taste, prompting the CECC to subject those with such symptoms to screening, he added.Previously, Taiwan only conducted COVID-19 tests on those with respiratory symptoms and fever who had recently traveled to countries with coronavirus outbreaks, or who had contact with coronavirus patients.The CECC last week further expanded the scope of screening to medical and healthcare workers with suspected infection symptoms in order to prevent possible cluster infections in the nation's healthcare system.Taiwan recorded 16 new infections on Tuesday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 322 with five deaths since the coronavirus emerged in China at the end of last year, according to CECC statistics.As of Tuesday, the CEEC had conducted 31,800 tests since the epidemic started in late December.(By Chen Wei-ting, Yu Hsiao-han and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310018

3/31/2020,Taiwan's surgical mask output hits 13 million per day,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's daily surgical mask output has hit 13 million, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Tuesday.The current daily output is more than four times the amount that Taiwan was capable of producing in early February, when Taiwan produced an average of 3.2 million surgical masks per day.That amount, however, is far from enough to meet the demand for surgical masks, which are widely used in Taiwan to prevent against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.In response to the high demand, the government banned the export of all surgical masks in late January, requisitioned all domestically produced masks, and instituted a rationing system to limit the number of masks people could buy per week.It also purchased 92 mask production lines, which have been set up in 40 days and have largely contributed to the significant surge in output.With the increase in output, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced Monday that people would be able to buy more masks under the rationing system in April.From April 9, residents will have access to nine masks for adults every 14 days, up from three per week at present, while the quota for children's masks will remain at 10 every two weeks, the CECC said.The MOEA is also discussing whether to purchase production lines that can produce N95 masks, which are able to filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles and are mainly used by medical workers on the frontlines.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310020

""MOFA will continue to work with the U.S. and other like-minded countries to advance our shared values and common goals and deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership on the global stage.""The TAIPEI Act was first introduced in the U.S. Senate by Cory Gardner last May, with Republican Congressman John Curtis unveiling a similar version in the House of Representatives in October, amid Beijing's continued efforts to squeeze Taiwan's international space.The legislation was passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier this month and later signed into law by Trump.The Act calls on the U.S. government to further Taiwan-U.S. bilateral trade and economic relations, help Taiwan participate in international organizations, and strengthen Taiwan's partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific region and in the world, according to Ou.It also authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider altering its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious actions to undermine Taiwan's security and prosperity, she said.The Republic of China (Taiwan), a founding member of the WHO, was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.International support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.Taiwan has been trying to rejoin the WHO since 1997. From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was able to participate in the WHA as an observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" with Beijing's approval, as cross-Taiwan Strait relations were warmer at the time.Since 2017, however, the year after President Tai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) took office, the Chinese government has been blocking Taiwan's efforts to participate in the WHA, due to differences between Taipei and Beijing over the so called ""1992 Consensus.""The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China,"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310022

3/31/2020,Taiwan's COVID-19 response could reach NT$1 trillion: premier,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The Taiwan government's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could reach as much as NT$1 trillion (US$33 billion), Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) told a legislative hearing on Tuesday.Such a figure would more adequately reflect the global nature of the crisis than the NT$60 billion special budget the Executive Yuan proposed in February, when the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was mainly limited to China, Su said.In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee De-wei (李德維) asked Su to detail the timing and scale of response measures being planned by the government, inquiring whether it would seek anything on the scale of Singapore's recently announced S$48 billion (US$33.65 billion) stimulus plan.""The overall scale will likely be around NT$1 trillion,"" Su said, arguing that the size of various countries' response measures will vary based on a variety of factors.In the United States, for example, people use private, rather than public insurance, while Taiwan uses the National Health Insurance program. Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310025

4/12/2020,127 European parliamentarians support Taiwan's WHA bid,"Taipei, April 12 (CNA) In a series of letters, 127 European parliamentarians have expressed support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwan's foreign ministry said Saturday.One of the letters, dated April 8 and addressed to European Union High Representative Josep Borrell, was signed by 67 EU parliamentarians from six party caucuses, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said.""The WHO treatment of Taiwan as part of China has caused problems for Taiwan,"" according to a copy of the letter that was posted on Twitter by one of the signatories, former Poland Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga.Not only is Taiwan's democratically elected government barred from participation in the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), but Taiwanese experts are also arbitrarily prevented from attending the WHO's technical meetings, the letter stated.""In these difficult times, the substantial cooperation in areas such as medical supplies, research and development of vaccines between Taiwan, the EU and its Member States would be beneficial in order to curb the further spread of the pandemic and better prepare for any future outbreak,"" the letter reads.One of the other letters was signed by 60 legislators of the German Parliament on April 2 and addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been heavily criticized by the U.S. and several other countries for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to MOFA.Anita Schäfer, chairperson of the German-Chinese Association-Friends of Taiwan, wrote in that letter that the WHO's treatment of Taiwan was inconsistent with its organizational values, MOFA said.The foreign ministry expressed appreciation for the support of the 127 European parliamentarians, saying they were the ""voice of justice.""The empathy of those parliamentarians for Taiwan is in sharp contrast to Tedros' biased statements about Taiwan, MOFA said.Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist, should be impartial and professional on the matter of the Taiwanese people's health and welfare, MOFA said.Since Taiwan was expelled from the WHO in 1972, its participation in the WHA as an observer has been limited to an eight-year period, from 2009 to 2016, amid relatively warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations during that time.International support for Taiwan's bid to rejoin in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.(By Chen Yun-yu and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004120001

5/7/2020,U.S. secretary of state urges WHO chief to invite Taiwan to WHA,"Washington, May 6 (CNA) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday called on the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA), saying it is within a WHO director-general's power to do so.In a press briefing, Pompeo reiterated Washington's support for Taipei's participation as an observer in this year's WHA, the decision-making body of the WHO, which will be held online from May 18-19 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.""Today I want to call upon all nations, including those in Europe, to support Taiwan's participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly and in other relevant United Nations venues,"" he said.He also urged WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to invite Taiwan to the WHA, ""as he has the power to do, and as his predecessors have done on multiple occasions.""Pompeo was referring to the fact that Tedros' predecessor, Margaret Chan (陳馮富珍), had sent invitations to Taiwan to observe the WHA from 2009 to 2016.Asked to comment if he will consider sending an invitation to Taiwan during a WHO press event held in Geneva that day, Tedros did not answer the question, referring it instead to WHO Legal Counsel Derek Walton.Walton reiterated the WHO's stance that the WHO secretariat has no authority to make such a decision unilaterally as it is to be made by all 194 member states.""The involvement, if any, of observers from 'Taiwan, China' in that assembly is a question for the 194 member governments, it's their decision,"" he noted.He also said that a number of member states have already raised proposals to discuss the matter at this year's WHA.He continued that whether or not Taiwan is invited to the assembly this year, there are ""well-established arrangements"" for health experts from ""Taiwan, China"" to work with the WHO on technical health matters.Taiwan participated in the WHA meetings from 2009 to 2016 as on observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei"" amid warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations under the then-Kuomintang (KMT) administration, which prioritized reducing cross-strait tension and building friendly ties with Beijing.Since 2017, however, China has persuaded the WHO not to invite Taiwan, in line with its hardline stance on cross-strait ties after President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office in May 2016.Explaining its decision for not sending invitations to Taiwan since 2017, the WHO said in 2019 that ""previous invitations to the WHA have been issued on the basis of a 'cross-strait understanding,'"" and that the ""absence of such an understanding"" in recent years has resulted in the fact that no more such invitations have been issued.According to the WHO Constitution, although the specialized agency under the U.N. does not recognize observer status, the rules of WHA procedure give the WHO director-general the right to invite observers to the annual WHA meeting, provided that they are ""States that have made application for membership, territories on whose behalf application for associate membership has been made, and States which have signed but not accepted the Constitution.""In response to Pompeo's remarks, Taiwan's foreign ministry on Thursday expressed gratitude, saying that it will continue to work closely with the U.S. and other like-minded countries in sharing Taiwan's success in containing the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The ministry also issued a protest over Walton's remarks that called the nation ""Taiwan, China,"" saying the designation belittled the nation's sovereignty.  (By Stacy Hsu, Tang Pei-chun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005070004

He was 96.Chung's son Chung Yen-wei (鍾延威) told reporters that the family found Chung not breathing around 7 p.m. Saturday.Chung Yen-wei said despite his father's old age, he was in relative stable health over the years. The family is deeply saddened and shocked by Chung's sudden passing and is now preparing his funeral.Born in Taoyuan's Longtan district in 1925 during Japanese rule, Chung was widely considered the doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement,"" who was most famous for his works, ""The Dull Ice Flower (魯冰花),"" ""the Turbid Waters Trilogy"" (濁流三部曲) and ""the Taiwanese Trilogy"" (台灣人三部曲).His classics of Taiwanese literature depicts the lives and fates of Taiwanese against the background of post-World War II Taiwan, following the end of the Japanese colonial period.In mourning the passing of Chung, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) expressed condolence to his family and said the passing of the nonagenarian literati is a great loss to the nation's literary circle.In a Facebook post, Tsai also praised Chung, an ethnic Hakka, for playing an import role in promoting Hakka culture and Taiwanese literature.Chung and other writers of his time had jointly published a regular newsletter in the post WWII era, the Literary Bulletin -- a periodical that proved essential to young and aspiring writers of that time, according to Tsai.Tsai said she will always remember Chung as an elder who saw her as his own child. She pledged to bear Chung's teaching in mind to continue the promotion of Hakka and Taiwanese culture so that Chung's legacy will last for generations to come.Asked to comment on Chung's legacy, writer Chen Fang-ming (陳芳明) told CNA that Chung had a tremendous impact toward the development of Taiwanese literature.Chung had played an crucial rule during the transitional period in the 1950s after the Kuomintang (KMT) had just taken over the governing of Taiwan from Japan at the end of Japanese colonial rule, according to Chen.Sincere condolences on the passing of #Hakka literary master Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政). The esteemed writer passed away on May 16 at the age of 96. https://t.co/zUbiiwwuCE pic.twitter.com/PH02BDFO0WAt that time, most Taiwanese could only speak Japanese and very few people could speak Mandarin, let alone write in the Chinese language. Chung was one of a handful of native Taiwanese writers of that time that can.Aside from focusing on his own works, Chung also published the Literary Bulletin that offered a platform for Taiwanese writers to publish their works.Chung's works had faithfully recorded the everyday lives of Taiwanese people of his time which showed his deep connection and affection toward his homeland, Chen noted.The Hakka Affairs Council, meanwhile, remembered Chung as not only a prolific writer but a devoted promoter of Hakka affairs who helped promote the awareness of Hakka culture to a national level, which successfully led to the creation in the 1990s of a dedicated Hakka language radio station.(By Chiu Chun-chin, Su Lung-chi Chen Ping-hung, Wu Hsin-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005170003

Those cases have not yet been classified as either local or imported, CECC data showed.To date, 395 COVID-19 patients in Taiwan have recovered, seven have died, with the remainder are still hospitalized, the CECC said in a statement.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 4,660,752 people in 187 countries and regions, including 1,489,642 in the United States, 272,043 in Russia, 240,161 in the United Kingdom, 230,698 in Spain and 224,760 in Italy, with a total of 311,064 fatalities, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.(By William Yen) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005170005
5/17/2020,Hostess club in Tainan reopens to customers amid COVID-19,"Tainan, May 17 (CNA) A hostess dance club in Tainan reopened Saturday, becoming the first such club in Taiwan's six major metropolitan areas to restart business after being shut down last month because of fears it could easily spread COVID-19.Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) said the city government issued a business resumption permit to the Wan Hsiang Dance Club (萬象舞廳) Friday after the club passed a government inspection.The 35-year-old Wan Hsiang Dance Club is so far the only legitimate hostess club among the five in the southern Taiwan city that has applied to reopen, according to Huang.City government officials said owners of the club pledged to implement the Central Epidemic Command Center's (CECC's) epidemic prevention guidelines against COVID-19 as it reopens its doors to customers.These guidelines include asking customers to follow social distancing measures, having them wear a face mask, taking their temperatures, and getting them to use hand sanitizer before entering the clubs.The club will also be required to control the flow of people by keeping a register of those entering, the city government said.The club's owners pledged to register the name and ID card numbers of each customer, and transparent plastic partitions have also been installed in each private booth to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Customers will also be forbidden to dance with a partner despite the resumption of operations, but will be allowed to dance alone, the club said, without elaborating.Huang said city officials will conduct inspections of the club to make sure it is following related guidelines, and the club will be closed for a week should violations be reported.Local media quoted the 75-year-old owner of the club surnamed Tseng (曾) as saying that the month-long suspension is the longest period of time the establishment has been closed during its 35-year history.The shutdown has seriously affected the livelihoods of the club's 100 employees and 200 hostesses, and they are all eager to see business resume, Tseng was cited as saying.The CECC on April 9 ordered hostess clubs across the country shut down, saying they posed a high risk of spreading COVID-19 after a hostess at a club in Taipei was confirmed to have the disease.As the number of cases dwindled to practically zero in the first week of May, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, announced on May 8 that local governments could decide whether to reopen their cities' hostess clubs under certain conditions.Tainan is the only one of Taiwan's six special municipalities -- which also include Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung -- to allow hostess bars to reopen so far.(By Chang Rong-hsiang and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005170006

5/17/2020,Taiwan advised to work with major economies after COVID-19,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan must seize the opportunity to work with major economies seeking to relocate global supply chains outside of China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic scholars suggested as President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) begins her second term on May 20.The pandemic, which has made many countries aware of their growing economic dependence on China for goods in several critical sectors, has led to calls to delink global supply chains of major industries from China.That trend offers an extremely good opportunity to Taiwan, said Ray Yang (楊瑞臨), consulting director of the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center (ISTI) under the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).He said the United States, China and Europe may all look to develop independent production capabilities in the post-COVID-19 world, and Taiwan has an opportunity to become an important partner for all of them.Yang said the U.S. will still be the world leader but cannot go it alone and will itself have to form partnerships with economies such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Taiwan is well positioned, Yang said, because the COVID-19 crisis has opened the world's eyes to the strengths of Taiwanese businesses, including their ability to respond quickly to different situations, high degree of flexibility and quality of manufactured goods.That was seen most clearly in Taiwan's ramping up of production of face masks and protective gear for medical workers to meet high demand during the coronavirus epidemic, he said.Meanwhile, Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, predicted that the U.S. economy would recover faster from the coronavirus pandemic than China.That trend has already prompted more Taiwanese businesses operating overseas to increase investment in Taiwan and reduce investment in China and other countries, Chiu said.Chiu also contended it will be in Taiwan's interests if the United States create an alliance of ""trusted partners"" to restructure supply chains away from China, as has been reported.According to a Reuters report in early May, the alliance would apply common standards for everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to trade, education and commerce, with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, India and Vietnam among potential partners.Though Taiwan is not on the list of ""trusted partners,"" it is a reasonable assumption that Taiwan has an opportunity to be included in the next phase given that Taiwan is considered a partner in the U.S.'s ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,"" Chiu said.""We must let the United States know that Taiwan can make its planned supply chains more complete,"" Chiu said, pointing to Taiwan's semiconductor industry's advantage in wafer fabrication and packaging and testing technology, which would help build the U.S.'s IC design capabilities.Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises' strength in producing spare parts and component production could also strengthen those new supply chains, Chiu said.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wu Po-wei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005170008
5/17/2020,Norwegian expats celebrate National Day with parade in Taiwan,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Norwegian expatriates in Taiwan held a parade and a flag-raising ceremony Sunday to celebrate Norway's National Day in what may have been the only parade around the world marking the occasion this year.More than a dozen Norwegians, some with their families, and about 60 members of the Taiwan Digital Diplomacy Association (TDDA), participated in the 40-minute parade that started in Daan District in Taipei and ended at the Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab, where the flag-raising ceremony was held.The activities were jointly organized by Norwegian nationals in Taiwan and the TDDA, a Taiwanese NGO dedicated to public diplomacy.""Interactions between Norway and Taiwan usually involve business or government issues. We hope today's event will bring the civil societies of the two countries closer,"" said TDDA Chairwoman Kuo Chia-yo (郭家佑), who began connecting with Norwegians in Taiwan three months ago.Other activities had been held in recent weeks to mark Norwegian National Day, including Norwegian cooking classes, a workshop on drawing a map of Norway, and a language-learning class, she said.Geir Yeh Fotland, a Norwegian born in Taiwan, told CNA that Norway's government has suspended all gatherings, including its National Day parade, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, making the Taipei event special.""I think this might be the only Norwegian National Day parade in the world, at least the longest with more than 60 people. So that's a great event,"" said Fotland, fondly called ""Norwegian grandpa"" by many Taiwanese who know him.Oslo is usually not keen on promoting Taiwan due to Beijing's influence in recent years, but major newspapers in Norway started to mention Taiwan in May because of its good performance in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, he said.""Taiwan has shown the world that we are independent from COVID-19 while the rest of the world is occupied by COVID-19, as Norway.""Oslo cut its official ties with Taipei in January 1950. Neither government has a liaison office on the other's soil after Oslo closed its trade office in Taipei in 2004 and Taipei closed its representative office in Norway in 2017.According to Fotland, there are about 10 Norwegian students and six to eight Norwegian nationals living in Taiwan, some of them retired and others here doing business.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005170009

5/17/2020,Rights group urges Taiwan to allow cross-national same-sex marriage,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) The Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) and several same-sex couples on Sunday urged Taiwan's government to allow same-sex marriages between couples from different countries.Taiwan's government legalized same-sex marriage in May 2019, becoming the first Asian country to do so.According to the Act Governing the Choice of Law in Civil Matters Involving Foreign Elements, however, a cross-national same-sex marriage can only be recognized in Taiwan if the countries of which the two partners are citizens both recognize same-sex marriage.The restriction discriminates against the LGBT community in Taiwan as marriage is a constitutional right, Pan Tien-ching (潘天慶), a lawyer from the TAPCPR, said at a press conference held near Taiwan's Presidential Office Building.Several cross-national same-sex couples lamented their difficult situations at the press conference.""For many cross-national same-sex couples, including me and my wife, our efforts to be with our loved ones are symbolized by our old plane ticket stubs,"" said Kaili Lai, a Taiwanese LGBT married to a Malaysian Tan Bee Guat.According to Lai, she and Tan held a simple wedding in Malaysia in 2016 with the blessings of their parents.Tan was not allowed to live in Taiwan, however because she was not a Taiwanese citizen and could not get a residence certificate because her marriage to Lai was not recognized.They had to fly frequently between Taiwan and Malaysia to see each other, leaving Tan little choice but to enroll in a university in Taiwan as a freshmen at the age of 35 to be able to stay in Taiwan on a student visa.But Tan is graduating next month and will have to enroll in a graduate school program to continue staying in Taiwan.Another cross-national same-sex couple, Joyce from Taiwan and Queenie from the Philippines, are facing the same predicament -- Queenie has to enroll in National Taiwan Normal University for the same purpose.According to the TAPCPR, the signature campaign it launched on May 9 to petition the government to amend laws that restrict same-sex marriage between such couples received 13,500 signatures and support from 20 human rights watchdogs in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Indonesia and the United States.The TAPCPR said it had written to relevant government units such as the Ministry of Justice, Mainland Affairs Council, National Immigration Agencies and the Ministry of Interiors on the issue.""Most government agencies have agreed that the issues need to be addressed but admitted that more coordination between relevant agencies is needed,"" the TAPCPR said as it urged President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to resolve the issue.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005170011

5/20/2020,Full text of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's second-term inaugural address,"Taipei, May 20 (CNA) The following is the full text of President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) inaugural address to start her second term, as released by the Presidential Office Wednesday:Vice President Lai, esteemed guests, friends watching on TV and online, my fellow citizens across the country, good morning.I feel immensely grateful to stand here once again today and take on the responsibility entrusted to me by the Taiwanese people.This inauguration ceremony is unique in the history of the Republic of China. What makes it special is not its size or the number of people in attendance. It is special because we know how difficult it has been for us to get to this point.I want to thank the people of Taiwan for making such a difficult feat possible.I particularly want to thank a group of people who have not received a lot of attention over the past four months in our fight against COVID-19. I want to thank every single person who waited in line outside of the pharmacy in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for trusting the government. You have shown the world Taiwan's commitment to civic virtues, even in times of greatest distress.I also want to thank everyone who was quarantined or isolated at home, putting up with inconvenience in your daily life to keep others safe and healthy. Thank you for exemplifying humanity's best qualities and helping us successfully bring the coronavirus outbreak under control.This sense of pride in our country, this community's shared destiny, and the memories of these past months will live on in all of our hearts. This is what solidarity feels like.Many ambassadors and representatives from other countries are here today, and I trust that many countries around the world are watching Taiwan as well.I want to take this opportunity to tell you that the country you see is populated by kind and resilient people. No matter the difficulties we face, we can always count on our democracy, our solidarity, and our sense of responsibility towards each other to help us overcome challenges, weather difficult times, and stand steadfast in the world.From January to now, Taiwan has amazed the international community twice. The first was our democratic elections, and the second was our success in the fight against COVID-19.In recent months, Taiwan's name has appeared in headlines around the world, thanks to our successful containment of the coronavirus outbreak.""Taiwan"" is also emblazoned on the boxes of supplies we are sending abroad. The Taiwanese people have the kindest hearts in the entire world, and we will always offer help to the international community whenever we are able.I hope that in addition to sharing in a sense of pride and joy, my fellow citizens can take to heart the spirit of ""helping ourselves to help others;"" ""when we help ourselves, others will help us.""This pandemic has not yet ended, and we must remain vigilant. Even when it ends, its impacts will linger on.The coronavirus has profoundly affected our world. It has changed the global political and economic order, accelerated and expanded the reorganization of global supply chains, restructured the global economy, and changed the way we live and shop. It has even changed the way the international community views Taiwan and developments in the surrounding region.These changes present us with both challenges and opportunities. I want to ask that my fellow citizens be prepared, because countless challenges and difficulties remain ahead of us.Over the next four years, only those who can end the pandemic within their borders, lay out a strategy for their country's survival and development, and take advantage of opportunities in the complex world of tomorrow, will be able to set themselves apart on the international stage.It takes more than fervor to govern a country. Leadership means calmly taking the right direction in a changing world. That is precisely what I have done over the past four years.I said before that I will leave you with a better country. So over the next four years, I will proactively develop our industries, foster a safe society, ensure national security, and deepen our democracy. I am going to reinvent Taiwan and lead our country into the future.1. Industrial and Economic DevelopmentI know that the Taiwanese people are most concerned about our industrial and economic development. In 2016, we initiated a new economic development model to help connect Taiwan's economy to the world. Over the past four years, despite massive changes in the international economy, Taiwan has done more than just weather the storm. Our economic growth has once again topped the Four Asian Tigers, and the stock market index now regularly breaks 10,000 points.Thanks to our successful control of the pandemic, so far, Taiwan is able to maintain positive economic growth. This is rare in the world. However, we need to continue to take early action on economic relief and revitalization, and do whatever it takes to maintain stable economic growth.Over the next four years, we will face more intense changes in the global economy and the accelerated reorganization of supply chains. We will continue to implement our Forward-looking Infrastructure Development and trillion NT-dollar investment programs. We will do so in the spirit of ""achieving growth through stability, and seizing opportunity amid changes,"" in order to secure Taiwan's economic development over the coming decades.In terms of industrial development, we are going to take advantage of the opportunities before us in six core strategic industries founded on our 5+2 Innovative Industries Program, to transform Taiwan into a critical force in the global economy.First, we will continue to develop our information and digital industries. We will take advantage of Taiwan's strengths in the semiconductor and ICT industries to secure a central role in global supply chains, and make Taiwan a major base for the development of next generation technologies, including IoT and AI.Second, we are going to develop a cybersecurity industry that can integrate with 5G, digital transformation, and our national security. We will strive to create cybersecurity systems and an industrial chain that can protect our country and earn the world's trust.Third, we are going to create biotech and medical technology industries integrated with the rest of the world. Throughout this pandemic, Taiwanese teams have proven that they are capable of working with world-class technologies to produce reagents and develop new drugs and vaccines. We are going to give these industries our utmost support, and transform Taiwan into a key force in the global battle against infectious diseases.Fourth, we are going to develop national defense and strategic industries by integrating military and civilian capabilities. In addition to domestically-produced naval vessel and aircraft programs that are currently underway, we will push harder to promote technological integration between the military and the private sector, to stimulate private sector production capabilities, and advance into the aviation and space industries.Fifth, we are going to accelerate the development of green energy and renewable energy industries. Over the past four years, renewable energy has experienced explosive growth, and Taiwan has become a hotspot for international investment. Building on this foundation, I am confident that we will achieve our goal of deriving 20% of our overall energy from green sources by 2025. We are going to make Taiwan a center for green energy in Asia.Sixth, we are going to establish strategic stockpile industries that can ensure the steady provision of critical supplies. Facing changes to the global order, we need to keep key industrial chains in Taiwan and maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the production of face masks, medical and daily supplies, energy, and food.In the current international climate, countries that end their dependence on others will have a head start on national development. I would like our friends across all industries to rest assured that our government stands with you. Over the next few years, we have several strategies to drive the growth of our industries.First, we will use domestic demand, particularly demand from the public sector and national security needs, as the basic engine for our industrial development.A prime example of this is the way strategic demand for face masks and other medical supplies throughout this pandemic has spurred the development of related industries. We can adopt a similar model for our national defense and renewable energy industries to help accelerate their development.We will continue to organize ""national teams,"" like our face mask team, according to the size and conditions of different industries. We will utilize our government's guarantee of domestic demand to establish a global strategic materials manufacturing industry under the ""Taiwanese brand"" and help it expand into other markets.We know that financial support is crucial to industrial development. Looking to the future, we will adopt more flexible financial policies, continue to reform financial systems, and use more diverse means to help industries obtain the financing they need.We will also work to create a safe environment for our industries. Our government is committed to maintaining sound public health and national security systems, a stable society, strong rule of law, and a healthy market. We need to offer these guarantees so that high-tech and strategic industries will be willing to choose Taiwan as their production and R&D base.We will also continue to guide the global expansion of our industries. We will keep working to sign trade or investment protection agreements with the United States, Japan, and European countries.As we continue to promote our New Southbound Policy, we will also develop other potential markets and encourage firms to establish operations there, giving our industries an edge when they engage in international cooperation. Overseas Taiwanese business communities around the world will be our best partners as we seek new international opportunities.Finally, we have the issue of talent. In order for Taiwan to become a key global economic force, we need a diverse talent pool. My government will bring in the world's top technical, R&D, and management talents to help globalize Taiwan's workforce, widen our industries' horizons, and give them the ability to compete in the international arena.Looking to the future, Taiwan must further connect with the international community. We will work to cultivate more outstanding bilingual and digital talents, giving our industries a global competitive edge.Over the next four years, Taiwan's economy will enter a new stage, complete with more flexible capital and talent flows, more robust industrial capabilities, and closer ties with the world. Together, we are going to enter a new era of shared prosperity.2. Safe Society: Health and Social Safety Nets to Catch Those Who Need HelpAs we develop our industries, we will also keep in mind that the people expect the government to foster a safe society. To be a better country, the government must take on more responsibilities to reduce the burden on the people and mitigate issues in society.Over the past few years, we have addressed Long-term Care 2.0, childcare, and residential justice issues. Over the next four years, my goal is to weave an even tighter net that can catch every single person who needs help and prevent future tragedies.●Health and Disease Prevention Safety NetFirst, we will strengthen our health and disease prevention safety net. Taiwan is an ageing society, and infectious diseases pose a serious challenge to the health of our people. That is why we need to bolster our disease prevention and treatment capabilities and link industries to make more breakthroughs in vaccine and new drug development, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, so that people can enjoy healthy lives and receive better care.●Mending Gaps in the Social Safety NetOur second step will be to mend the gaps in our social safety net. Over the past few years, a great deal of discussion has arisen around public safety incidents involving schizophrenia patients. The same goes for other mental illnesses, drug addiction, and domestic violence.I understand your concerns. These issues are not just the responsibility of individuals or families, they are the responsibility of the government. When families are unable to provide proper care, the government has a duty to step in and help.I am going to upgrade our social care system, enhance the capabilities of frontline social workers, and improve their work environments, so that they can work at the grassroots and identify people who have fallen through the gaps in our safety net.We cannot hold medical agencies or individual judges solely responsible for controversies surrounding specific cases. Our judicial and executive branches should reevaluate and optimize these systems and take initiatives to make any necessary legal amendments.3. National Security: National Defense Reforms, Active International Participation, Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsA better country requires a greater emphasis on national security. Over the past four years, we have pushed for national defense reforms, active international participation, and peaceful, stable cross-strait relations. We hope that Taiwan can play a more active role in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Over the next four years, the direction of our policies will remain the same, and we will do even more.●National Defense ReformsWe have three important directions for our national defense reforms. First is accelerating the development of our asymmetrical capabilities. While we work to bolster our defense capabilities, future combat capacity development will also emphasize mobility, countermeasures, and non-traditional asymmetrical capabilities. We will also work to strengthen our defenses against the threats of cyber warfare, cognitive warfare, and ""unrestricted"" warfare to achieve our strategic goal of multidomain deterrence.The second is substantive reforms to our military reserve and mobilization systems. We need to enhance the quality of our reserve forces, as well as their weapons, equipment, and training, in order to achieve effective jointness with our regular forces. We also need to establish a standing, interdepartmental system connecting our reserve and mobilization systems. This system will help coordinate personnel and supplies, so that we can successfully mobilize during a transition from peacetime to war.Third is improvements to our military's management institutions. Today's young servicemembers have all grown up in a democratic society, and one of our most important missions will be to find ways for them to better utilize their professional skills in line with military needs.Some young servicemembers have difficulties adjusting to military needs, reflecting the gap between today's society and our military management institutions. We need to work to close that gap. We need to reduce negative societal views of the military and end the gradual erosion of our military's prestige and morale due to individual incidents caused by imperfect institutions.Thus, we will improve appeal and counseling mechanisms within the military, establish a fair and equitable incident investigation mechanism, and regularly evaluate personnel placements. In terms of education and training, we will strengthen leadership capacities across all levels of leadership and foster a modern management system that emphasizes professionalism.We need to strike a balance between the team-oriented military discipline needed for actual combat and society's respect for the individual.●Active International ParticipationOver the past four years, we have actively taken part in addressing major global issues, including counter-terrorism cooperation, humanitarian assistance, religious freedom, and nontraditional security.Throughout this global pandemic, we have been praised for providing selfless assistance to the international community wherever we are able.Taiwan has been deemed a democratic success story, a reliable partner, and a force for good in the world by the international community. All Taiwanese people should take pride in this.Over the next four years, we will continue to fight for our participation in international organizations, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with our allies, and bolster ties with the United States, Japan, Europe, and other like-minded countries.We will also participate more actively in regional cooperation mechanisms and work hand-in-hand with countries in the region to make concrete contributions to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.●Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsIn the face of complex and changing cross-strait circumstances, we have made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait over the past four years, gaining approval from the international community. We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security.Here, I want to reiterate the words ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue."" We will not accept the Beijing authorities' use of ""one country, two systems"" to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle.We will continue to handle cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. This has been our consistent position for maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Cross-strait relations have reached a historical turning point. Both sides have a duty to find a way to coexist over the long term and prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences. Faced with changing circumstances, I will hold firm to my principles, adopt an open attitude to resolve issues, and shoulder my responsibilities as President. I also hope that the leader on the other side of the Strait will take on the same responsibility, and work with us to jointly stabilize the long-term development of cross-strait relations.While we work to achieve national development, it is crucial that we optimize our government institutions over the next four years. Our Legislative Yuan will establish a constitutional amendment committee, giving us a platform to engage in dialogue and reach a consensus on constitutional reforms pertaining to government systems and people's rights.This democratic process will enable the constitutional system to progress with the times and align with the values of Taiwanese society. Our first priority should be to lower the voting age from 20 to 18, an issue on which both the majority and opposition parties are in agreement.In terms of judicial reform, I delivered on my promise to convene a National Congress on Judicial Reform, and we completed amendments to the Judges Act, the Attorney Regulation Act, the Constitutional Court Procedure Act, and the Labor Incident Act. This is all base work for the further improvement of our judicial system.However, our judicial reforms are still in transition, and our current progress has not yet met the public's expectations. I will continue to solicit opinions from across society and keep pressing forward. The people's dissatisfaction drives us to continue on the path of reform.Within the next four years, we need to implement a lay judge system, so that citizens can act as lay judges in court and become catalysts for judicial reform. This will help bridge the distance between the people and our judicial system, so that it aligns better with their expectations and earns their trust.All constitutional institutions must also continue on the path of reform. The Executive Yuan will reevaluate and reinitiate its organizational reform process, including the establishment of a specialized digital development agency and adjustments to all ministries in line with current needs. This will enable governance capabilities to be more responsive to the needs of national development.The National Human Rights Commission under the Control Yuan will officially be established in August of this year. This will be a milestone in our journey to place human rights at the center of Taiwan's national ethos, and marks the start of a new chapter for the Control Yuan.Our new Examination Yuan team will be instated in September, and I will ask them to propose a comprehensive reform plan and evaluate past policies, so that they can become an effective human resource department that can cultivate the talent a modern government needs.My fellow citizens, over the past 70 years, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has grown more resilient and unified through countless challenges. We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation. We have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Although we were once isolated in the world, we have always persisted in the values of democracy and freedom, no matter the challenges ahead of us. We will always remain committed to our common belief: Taiwan must help ourselves to help others, and when we help ourselves, others will help us.Many of the heroes in our fight against COVID-19 are here with us today, including members of our national face mask team, our Central Epidemic Command Center's public health team, and Premier Su Tseng-chang's team.There are many more heroes from all walks of life not in attendance today: medical workers, postal workers, pharmacists, convenience store clerks, taxi drivers, and many more.I may not be able to call out all of your names, but I want everyone to know that Taiwan has overcome countless challenges over the past 70 years, relying on not just one or two heroes, but thanks to countless heroes such as yourselves, working together to turn the wheels of history. You have helped make Taiwan a happy, safe, and prosperous place for generations to come.I want to express my respect to all of you. Every single person in Taiwan is a hero. Vice President Lai and I are honored to take on the responsibility you have entrusted to us.Taking on the responsibility of the President of the Republic of China in such difficult times brings me more pressure than joy. But I will not back down, because all of you are with me.The path forward will not be easy, and greater challenges await us. But we are a country that has persevered through even the greatest hardships. We, the 23 million people, have always been and will always be a community with a shared destiny.I truly hope that all of my fellow citizens will remember how it felt to come together to overcome the challenges of the past few months. The Republic of China can be united. Taiwan can be safe. Being Taiwanese can be an honor that makes you hold your head high.My dear citizens, the path ahead of us is long, and we are about to begin a new chapter in Taiwan's story. Taiwan's story belongs to each and every one of us, and it needs each and every one of us.I ask that the 23 million people of Taiwan act as our guides and partners. Let us pool our wisdom and courage and make this country a better place together. Thank you.（For the full text in Mandarin: 最特別的就職典禮 蔡總統：感謝台灣人民【演說全文】）",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005200003

5/22/2020,A new 'internet for everything' era on the way: expert,"By Kay Liu, CNA staff writerThe global COVID-19 pandemic has upended people's lives, giving terms such as stay at home, work from home, and social distancing added resonance and accentuating the importance of the internet in connecting with others and doing one's job.What many are wondering is if these lifestyle changes will become entrenched and workplaces permanently altered even as the pandemic eases and people can move freely again.Kenny Huang, the chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), says the trends are here to stay, and he foresees a world of ""internet for everything,"" in which even more tasks will be done online.""Before the pandemic, the internet was an information technology tool. For businesses, it was used to help with operations, marketing or other areas. But in the post-COVID-19 era, all business activities will likely be connected to the internet,"" Huang said in a recent interview with CNA.Huang is in as good a position as anybody to look into the future of cyberspace.His TWNIC, which manages domain names ending with .tw and internet protocol (IP) addresses in Taiwan, routinely conducts surveys and issues reports on internet use that offer insights into trends and developments in the online world and help businesses make decisions.He believes COVID-19 has already made the internet part of a new reality because people no longer feel that things have to be done face-to-face, at least judging by the surge in online traffic and bandwidth he has observed from Dec. 30, 2019 to March 23.Huang estimates that the internet is used in about 10 percent of everyday work at present, but he expects that to go much higher in the future as habits change.Possible risksThe increasingly internet-dependent world that Huang envisions could have a downside, however, with risks that already exist such as threats to cybersecurity or the monopolization of information potentially magnified, he said.He pointed to the possibility of a wider spread of disinformation if people become more reliant on digital media as a news source.""There are always new solutions, but there will always be new types of disruptions,"" said Huang, who used the example of fake news evolving from pure fiction to mixing in some facts to create misinformation.The new solutions, he said, are the likes of the review mechanism introduced by Facebook and Twitter and the work of organizations such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center.Social mediaSocial media could also fall prey to the growing importance of the internet, Huang suggested.At its core, the internet is about transmitting data and connecting devices, while social media plays the role of ""connecting people, who share and exchange the knowledge and views they have,"" he said.Interactions online may mirror those in the real world, but they are not perfect reflections, he said.They could become even more imperfect as reliance on the internet means users gravitate to only a few major service providers, and those platforms' user agreement and rules become, in effect, the rules of society, Huang cautioned.According to the center's annual Taiwan Internet Report for 2019, 79.2 percent of those surveyed between September and November last year used online social media, of whom 98.9 percent used Facebook, 38.8 percent used Instagram and only 5.6 percent used Twitter.Security concernsBehind the changing of habits seen during the global pandemic, the introduction of fifth generation wireless technology (5G) could also profoundly affect user habits by offering accessible, fast internet access at an affordable price.But its arrival has posed a challenge to Taiwan's government that may dominate the debate over cyberspace in the post-COVID-19 world -- balancing an open ecosystem with security concerns.In terms of 5G, the existing internet environment could make it easy for just a few companies to become dominant players, and they may be foreign and even hostile to Taiwan's interests. That has led Taiwan's government to intervene in the 5G arena by banning the use of essential equipment from certain suppliers or countries, especially China, on the grounds of national security, Huang said.Such fears have extended into other areas, including to internet services, he said, citing the example of China-based video-conferencing service Zoom, which has soared in popularity during the pandemic but was banned in Taiwan for government and school use over security concerns.Yet the government has not been as interventionist in other social or commercial domains, Huang said, citing the example of the growing popularity of foreign online streaming services that are full of content from China.The TWNIC report found that 84.5 percent of those surveyed watched online video or streamed content, 76.3 percent of which was produced in Taiwan, followed by China (42.2 percent), the United States (38.2 percent), Japan (35.2 percent), South Korea (34.4 percent) and Europe (13.2 percent).Striking a balance between free speech and China's attempts to use cultural power to spread its message in Taiwan will not be easy for the government, Huang said.Personal protectionMeanwhile, Huang warned that we all, at some level, will have to be prepared for the pitfalls of being heavily reliant on the online world.Shutdowns of service ""have happened and could still happen, and the impact on us will only increase because the time we spend and our reliance on internet services is growing,"" he said.""When using online services, people need to think ahead and have a plan B in case a company shuts down operations. Everyone should back up data routinely, update online accounts, update passwords, and not allow cookies when browsing online when they are not necessary,"" he advised.Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005220009

5/22/2020,Global support for Taiwan at record high: former U.S. official,"Washington, May 21 (CNA) Randall G. Schriver, a former United States assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said Thursday that Taiwan has won huge global support because of its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, despite China's suppression.""Taiwan's international recognition, international admiration for Taiwan, international support for Taiwan has almost never been higher, because we see the juxtaposition of how the PRC has handled the coronavirus and how Taiwan has,"" Schriver said at a virtual conference hosted by the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.Schriver also berated China for poaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies and seeking to exclude Taiwan from global bodies like the World Health Organization.The Communist Party of China's ""approach to Taiwan has failed, not by my measure but by their own measure,"" he said in the forum, titled U.S.-Taiwan Relations and Taiwan's Evolving Role in the Global Order.As a result of China's failed policies, it has destroyed any pathway for what it calls peaceful reunification and any remaining constituency for a future ""one China,"" Schriver said.China's proposed 'one country, two systems' unification framework ""never had much of a constituency in Taiwan, but polls now regarding what aspirations people have for a future arrangement ... have never been worse from China's perspective,"" he said. ""So it is very difficult to see re-sinification of Taiwan through peaceful means.""In light of that situation, Schriver said, the U.S. should be concerned about a growing temptation on the part of China to use more military tools and coercion against Taiwan.Under such circumstances, the U.S. and Taiwan should strengthen cooperation in the field of information sharing, he said, adding that he supports U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to help boost its defense capability.Also at the forum, Evan Medeiros, Penner Family chair in Asian studies and the Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations, said it is becoming more difficult for the U.S. to strike a balance in supporting Taiwan while seeking to build a constructive relationship with China, given that China is growing more confident in East Asia, and Taiwan is facing increasing pressure and coercion from Beijing.Medeiros said the U.S. should take its security pledge to Taiwan seriously, sell Taiwan more weapons based on the Taiwan Relations Act, and help Taiwan join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Chin-yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005220011

5/22/2020,"Torrential rains to ease Saturday, but threat remains: CWB","Taipei, May 22 (CNA) The torrential rainfall that drenched Taiwan on Friday could ease up on Saturday, but heavy rainfall could still affect the central and southern parts of the country, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) warned.Taiwan is likely to see less rainfall over the weekend as the plum rain front that brought the deluge moves south toward the Bashi Channel and southeasterly winds weaken, forecasters said.According to the CWB, northern Taiwan and low-lying areas in central Taiwan should see milder weather, though they could still get heavy rain, defined by the CWB as more than 80 millimeters of rainfall over a 24 hour-period or 40 mm of rainfall in one hour.Mountainous areas in central Taiwan and low-lying areas in southern Taiwan could see extremely heavy rain, which the CWB defines as more than 200 mm of rainfall over a 24 hour-period or over 100 mm in three hours.In the south, mountainous areas in Chiayi County and some low-lying areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung could even see torrential rain, equal to more than 350 millimeters of rainfall over a 24-hour period, the bureau said.In mountainous areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, ""extreme torrential rain"" of more than 500 mm of rainfall could fall over a 24-hour period, the bureau forecast.Meanwhile, lightning, strong gusts, rock falls, mudslides and flooding are likely islandwide, according to the CWB.On Friday, some schools and offices were closed, and flooding and traffic disruptions were reported around Taiwan due to the inclement weather.Parts of Kaohsiung and Pingtung, where water levels were calf-deep, saw the most severe flooding in Taiwan.The heaviest rainfall was recorded in Sandimen Township in Pingtung, with 550 mm of precipitation accumulated between midnight and 6 p.m. Friday.In northern Taiwan's Hsinchu, rock falls blocked railroad tracks at around noon, causing delays for 1,400 passengers on 10 Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) trains.Several roads, including sections of the Southern Cross-Island Highway in the south, were also closed as a precautionary measure, transportation authorities said.According to the Education Ministry, 26 schools across Taiwan, most of which were in Tainan and Kaohsiung, have reported damage of up to NT$1.59 million (US$53,200) due to the torrential rains.(By Wang Shu-fen, Chen Chao-fu, Chen Chi-chung and Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005220018
5/22/2020,Few mentions of Taiwan in annual speech by Chinese premier: scholars,"Taipei, May 22 (CNA) Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克強) made scant mention of Taiwan in an important annual speech Friday, reflecting China's focus on its economy as it juggles a trade war with the United States and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, according to scholars of cross-strait relations.On Friday morning, Li delivered the government's work report -- a speech often compared to the U.S. state of the union address -- at the opening of China's annual parliamentary meeting, the National People's Congress.The 14,000 word speech was shorter than in previous years, which have averaged around 20,000 words, and also notable in that its references to Taiwan were limited to about 100 words.Tung Li-wen (董立文), an advisory board member at Taiwan Thinktank, told CNA Friday that the relatively minor references to Taiwan in the speech show that China currently has its hands full managing the economic impact of its trade war with the U.S. and the COVID-19 pandemic.As relates to Taiwan, Tung noted that last week China unveiled 11 incentives targeting Taiwanese businesses operating in China, showing that the country needs to retain Taiwanese talent and technology amid the tough economic climate.Chang Yu-shao (張宇韶), deputy secretary of the Cross-Strait Policy Association, characterized the language on Taiwan in the speech as ""soft in tone, but not without its jagged edges.""Li did not invoke political concepts such as ""one country, two systems"" or the ""1992 consensus"" in reference to Taiwan, and instead relied on broader appeals to Chinese nationhood, Chang said.At the same time, the speech omitted the word ""peaceful"" in its reference to ""national reunification,"" he said.The speech's more hardline content came in the announcement of new national security legislation for Hong Kong, though this also contained a sort of implicit threat to Taiwan, Chang said.Meanwhile, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded to Li's speech Friday with language from President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) recent inaugural address.In a statement, the MAC rejected China's ""one country, two systems"" model for ""downgrading Taiwan and undermining the cross-strait status quo.""Instead, it urged Beijing to accept Tsai's principles of ""peace, parity, democracy and dialogue"" as the foundation for cross-strait interaction.(By Lai Yen-hsi and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005220019

3/4/2020,TSMC teams up with Broadcom in 5nm process development,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has joined forces with U.S.-based integrated circuit designer Broadcom Inc. in advanced 5 nanometer process development.In a statement released Tuesday, TSMC said it has teamed up with Broadcom to strengthen the Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) integrated circuit packaging platform that supports 5nm technology.According to TSMC, CoWoS provides best-in-breed performance and highest integration density for high performance computing applications, and the particular wafer level system integration platform offers a wide range of interposer sizes, a number of high bandwidth memory (HBM) cubes, and package sizes.The cooperation with Broadcom means TSMC will provide one-stop services from IC packaging to pure wafer foundry services to Broadcom, which has come on board with other foreign tech giants such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Huawei Technolgies Inc., to use the Taiwanese chipmaker's 5nm process technology.In addition to contract chip production, TSMC has started high-end IC packaging operations in a bid to provide its customers with a wide range of comprehensive services.The 7 nanometer process is the latest technology the chipmaker has begun mass producing, while the company is also developing the more sophisticated 5mn and 3mn processes.TSMC is scheduled to launch mass production of the 5nm process in the first half of this year. The 3nm process is expected to begin commercial production in 2022.Through its partnership with Broadcom, TSMC's next generation CoWoS packaging services provide bandwidth of up to 2.7 terabytes per second, which is 2.7 times faster than the CoWoS solution the chipmaker previously offered in 2016.TSMC said with higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the CoWoS solution jointly developed with Broadcom is well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as deep learning, workloads for 5G networking and power-efficient data centers.At an investor conference held in mid-January, TSMC said the company expects to benefit from solid demand for smartphones, high performance computer (HPC) devices, Internet of Things related applications and automotive electronics this year.Amid optimism over global demand, TSMC has devoted itself to high-end technology development, a move expected to boost its global competitive edge and sustain the company's lead over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., which has started advanced technology processes with an eye to gaining a larger share of the global market.For the development of its high-end processes, TSMC has said capital expenditure for 2020 is expected to range from US$15-16 billion, the highest level in the company's history.Currently, TSMC has more than 50 percent of the global pure wafer foundry market.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003040004

The Dow plunged 3.58 percent Thursday.""Market sentiment here was moved by a soaring VIX on the U.S. markets as investors at home and abroad feared the COVID-19 spread in the U.S., the largest economy in the world, will further affect the global economy.""The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX), which is widely considered an ideal gauge of fear in the market, soared about 14 percent overnight.The spread of the COVID-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has undermined production in China and interrupted global supply chains. The contagion could also hurt private consumption in the U.S.Since the novel coronavirus first emerged at the end of December, more than 96,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with infections in more than 80 countries and territories and more than 3,300 deaths, the majority of which have been in China.""Such unfavorable circumstances are expected to pose threats to Taiwan's export-oriented economy,"" Su said.It was no surprise that Friday's selling in Taiwan focused on the bellwether electronics sector, which depends heavily on global demand, Su said.As of 10:58 a.m., TSMC had lost 2.01 percent to NT$316.50 with 25.07 million shares changing hands after its American depositary receipts (ADRs) lost 2.37 percent on U.S. markets overnight.Led by TSMC, the electronics sector was down 1.43 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index was down 1.76 percent.Also in the high tech sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had lost 1.93 percent to NT$81.10, while Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., was little changed at NT$4,600.00.Following a 1.45 percent fall in its ADRs overnight, integrated circuit packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. had lost 2.99 percent to NT$71.40, while IC designer MediaTek Inc. had lost 1.17 percent to NT$380.50.Selling was also seen among large cap old economy stocks with Formosa Plastics Corp. down 1.61 percent at NT$91.80 and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 2.15 percent at NT$68.20.In the financial sector, Fubon Financial Holding Co. had fallen 1.88 percent to NT$44.30, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. had lost 1.37 percent to NT$39.60.""The silver lining was that the magnitude of the fall in the local market was not as heavy as elsewhere in the world as the TWSE remained awash in liquidity and many investors appeared willing to park their money here,"" Su said.""I expect the Taiex will see strong support at around the 240-day moving average of 11,049 points,"" Su said.

3/13/2020,Stabilization fund ready to shore up equity market: MOF,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Finance Minister Su Jain-rong (蘇建榮) on Friday said the National Financial Stabilization Fund is ready to lend support to the local equity market and its committee could meet at anytime if necessary, amid global volatility spurred by escalating fears over the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 worldwide.At a news conference held at around 8:15 a.m., 45 minutes before the local equity market opened, Su urged investors to remain confident in Taiwan's economic fundamentals, saying the Ministry of Finance, the central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission will come up with measures to stabilize the stock market.Su made the comments as concerns over the spread of COVID-19 intensfied, sending ripples through global financial markets.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,352 points or almost 10 percent, the largest single session drop since Oct. 19, 1987, when the index shed 22.6 percent amid a global financial crisis, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index also dropped more than 9 percent even though the U.S. Federal Reserve took the unusual step of injecting funds into the market.Despite Su's remarks, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taiex still opened down 331.29 points at 10,091.03 and the weakness continued on panic-led selling across the board.Su said the stabilization fund is watching the local equity market closely and its committee could meet anytime, if necessary, and jump into the market to counter the impact of global volatility.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.The fund intervenes in the market when it receives authorization from the fund committee, which is currently managed by Vice Finance Minister Juan Ching-hwa (阮清華), who is executive secretary of the fund.However, Su said with the virus, originally from the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading worldwide, it is no surprise that the global economy faces severe challenges with plunging equity markets around the world.In addition to the dive on the U.S. markets, the equity markets in France, Germany and the United Kingdom also tumbled 12.28 percent, 12.24 percent and 10.87 percent, respectively, Thursday.Compared with the markets in the U.S. and Europe, Juan said, Taiwanese equities appear resilient despite the ongoing scare over the virus. He cited data from Feb. 24 to March 12, showing that the Taiex fell 10.82 percent, while the Dow dropped 26.88 percent, and the markets in France, Germany and the U.K. shed 32.93 percent, 32.54 percent and 29.26 percent, respectively.The relatively small drop in Taiwan came as the country has executed efficient and effective measures to contain the spread of the virus, Juan said, adding that healthy economic fundamentals and attractive dividend yields in the equity market have enabled Taiwanese stocks to fend off unfavorable external factors to some extent.""It is unnecessary for investors to panic,"" Juan said, ""They should have faith in the local equity market.""(By Wu Chia-jung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003130003

3/28/2020,Extreme heavy rain alert issued for Taitung,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) An extreme heavy rain alert has been issued for Taitung County in southeastern Taiwan on Saturday due to the effects of a weather front, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).The CWB said precipitation on Orchid Island of Taitung is expected to become apparent and will continue into Saturday afternoon due to the weather front, warning people living in low-lying areas of floodwaters.The bureau has lifted a heavy rain warning it had previously imposed earlier Saturday for the areas south of Taoyuan City as the weather front is passing, but it warned of possible occasional heavy rainfall in northern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula in the south.Under the bureau's definition, heavy rain means accumulated rainfall of 80 millimeters or more within a 24-hour period or rainfall of 40 mm or more in an hour, while extreme heavy rain is defined as accumulated rainfall of 200 mm or more within 24 hours.Along with the rainfall brought by the weather front, an accelerating northeasterly wind system is expected to cool northern Taiwan down as temperature highs are forecast to fall to 21-24 degrees Celsius Saturday from about 30 degrees a day earlier.Daytime temperatures in central and southern Taiwan are expected to fall in a moderate pace to 27-28 and 29-30 degrees, respectively, on Saturday, from 31-32 degrees a day earlier, the CWB said.With the weather front intensifying, the CWB said, the mercury around Taiwan will fall further from Saturday night through early Sunday morning.The bureau forecast temperatures will dip to 15 degrees in northern Taiwan, 16-17 degrees in central Taiwan and 18-19 degrees in the south on Sunday.It urged the public to keep a close eye on a wide day-night temperature gap, in particular in central and southern Taiwan, and to stay warm.In addition, the CWB said, the wind system is also expected to bring in strong winds for the areas north of Tainan, eastern Taiwan including Orchid Island and Green Island, the Hengchun Peninsula, as well as the outlying Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands Saturday.Such low temperatures are expected to continue into Sunday but drier weather is likely, with only sporadic showers expected in northeastern Taiwan and the mountainous areas in the north, the CWB said.Meanwhile, air quality in the north as well as Yilan, Hualien and Taitung in eastern Taiwan and the outlying Matsu and Penghu islands were rated ""good"" on Saturday, while it was ""fair"" in central Taiwan, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south, as well as Kinmen, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said.(By Chen Chun-shuo and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003280001

3/28/2020,U.S. reportedly eyes curb of TSMC's supply to Huawei,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) The United States has been aiming to curb the supply of chips sold by contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to China's Huawei Technologies Co. through planned heavier sanctions against the Chinese telecom equipment giant, according to a Reuters report.The report said while tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating with both sides blaming each other for spreading the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Trump administration has a plan to introduce new measures to further restrict global chip sales to Huawei.Under the proposed new rules, the report, dated Thursday in Washington, said foreign companies that use U.S. production equipment to roll out their chips would be required to obtain a U.S. license ahead of sales of certain chips to Huawei, which was blacklisted last year.Citing unnamed sources, the report said the measures are aimed at curbing supplies of chips to Huawei's integrated circuit design subsidiary arm HiSilicon Technologies Co. from TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.The report said it remained unknown whether President Donald Trump will approve the new sanction measures since he appeared to oppose the measures in February. If the new measures are imposed, Huawei and TSMC, as well as American enterprises, will feel the pinch, it said.The report quoted a research paper written by China-based Everbright Securities last year as saying most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials.""This is going to have a far more negative impact on U.S. companies than it will on Huawei, because Huawei will develop their own supply chain,"" trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said in the report. ""Ultimately, Huawei will find alternatives.""In Taipei, TSMC said it was unable to respond to any ""hypothetical questions"" and would not comment on any individual clients.According to a market estimate, Huawei accounts for about 10 percent of TSMC's total sales. Market analysts said if the strict rules are imposed, TSMC will see its shipments squeezed.After the possible heavier sanctions against Huawei surfaced, shares of TSMC gave up earlier gains of 2.14 percent on the Friday trading session in Taipei, falling 2.50 percent to close at NT$273.00 (US$9.03) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index also came off an earlier high of 9,954.86 points, down 0.38 percent to end at 9,698.92.On Friday, foreign institutional investors sold a net 5.23 million TSMC shares, stopping a three-day streak of a net buy, but for the entire week, such investors recorded a net buy of 28.47 million TSMC shares.TSMC's American depositary receipts on the U.S. market also fell 5.94 percent overnight as the market came under pressure amid fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.(By Emmanuelle Tseng, Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003280003

3/31/2020,All 214 evacuees from Hubei placed in quarantine,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The 214 Taiwanese nationals who returned to Taiwan on Monday night after being stranded in Hubei province by the new coronavirus outbreak have been placed in quarantine and will soon be tested for COVID-19.The passengers were taken by about a dozen tour buses to an undisclosed quarantine venue in northern Taiwan at around 1 a.m. Tuesday after undergoing health screenings at the airport, and will be quarantined for 14 days.Military servicemen chemically disinfected the vehicles after the passengers reached the quarantine facility.All returnees will be tested for COVID-19 within 48 hours, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center.The handling of these Taiwanese who were stuck in Hubei province after it went into lockdown in late January to contain the spread of the new coronavirus has been controversial.They were all put on a list of people who required special permission to return to Taiwan, unlike other Taiwanese currently returning from areas where the virus seems much more active, such as the United States and Europe.Those on the list are being required to return on special pre-arranged flights, which the government is describing as ""charter-like flights,"" and then put in quarantine in government-run facilities after arriving home.People arriving from other parts of China or other parts of the world can take regularly scheduled commercial flights to Taiwan and self-quarantine at home for 14 days.The 214 Taiwanese had to make their way on their own from Hubei province to Shanghai's Pudong International Airport to catch the special flight operated by China Airlines, which departed at 8:02 p.m. Monday and arrived at Taoyuan International Airport at 9:38 p.m.It was the second of two special flights contracted by the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a semi-official agency that handles cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in the absence of formal bilateral ties, to bring home Taiwan citizens stuck in Hubei.The first was arranged late Sunday, when 153 Taiwanese returned home.These Taiwanese had been stranded in Hubei since late January but were able to leave the area after restrictions on the movement of people there were lifted on March 25.Many others are still stuck in Wuhan, but will be able to leave if restrictions there are lifted on April 8 as scheduled.(By Liu Chien Pang and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310002

However, it was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.It has not been a member of the United Nations or the WHO since then.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310005
3/31/2020,Hon Hai shares edge higher on 2019 results,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker that churns out many of Apple's iPhones, moved higher Tuesday morning after it reported an increase in earnings per share (EPS) for 2019, dealers said.The gains were limited, however, as investors were wary of a fall in Hon Hai's profit margins amid escalating competition in the global market and concerns over a possible delay in the launch of the next generation iPhones amid the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.As of 11:38 a.m., shares of Hon Hai had gained 0.29 percent to NT$70.20 (US$2.32), off a high of NT$70.50, on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index was up 1.13 percent at 9,738.67 following gains in the U.S. overnight.In a statement released Monday, Hon Hai said it posted net profit of NT$115.31 billion in 2019, down 10.65 percent from a year earlier, but its EPS of NT$8.32 beat its EPS of NT$8.03 in 2018.Analysts said the EPS growth largely resulted from Hon Hai's move to cut its capitalization by about 20 percent in 2018 to NT$138.63 billion to maintain its EPS above the NT$8 level.It was the first time the company had lowered its capital since it first listed publicly in June 1991.Though EPS rose in 2019, the company's lower gross margin and operating profit margin fell due to intensifying global competition, giving investors pause.The company had a gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- of 5.91 percent in 2019, down 0.36 percentage points from a year earlier, and its net margin -- the difference between its gross profit and its total expenses -- was down 0.29 percentage points to 2.15 percent in 2019.Its operating profit margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- was also down 0.42 percentage points to 2.15 percent.In addition to cutting its paid-in capital, Hon Hai was also able to maintain its EPS above NT$8 in 2019 because of efforts to automate its production, a fall in the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, and a sharp decline in the losses of subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd.The Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, in which Hon Hai holds a 62.8 percent stake, cut its net loss to US$12.29 million in 2019 from US$857.12 million a year earlier because of efforts to keep costs down.Hon Hai had consolidated sales of NT$5.34 trillion in 2019, the highest in the company's history, but they were only up 0.92 percent from a year earlier.Hon Hai said it has scheduled an annual general meeting for June 23.Analysts have estimated that Hon Hai's sales in the first quarter of 2020 will fall 40 percent from NT$1.74 trillion in the fourth quarter to below NT$1 trillion because of slow season effects and falling demand caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.(By Chung Jung-feng and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310006

3/31/2020,Migrant factory employees call for dorms to be moved offsite,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A coalition of migrant rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations staged a rally in Taipei on Tuesday, calling for factory dormitories to be relocated away from the work site in the interest of safety.The approximately 50 people, gathered outside the Ministry of Labor (MOL), cited three incidents in recent years, in which 11 migrant workers and six firefighters died in blazes that broke out at factories that had dorms on the premises.In the most recent incident, three Vietnamese workers, who were housed in a dorm on the second floor of a metal manufacturing plant in Taichung, died when the factory went up in flames on March 22.""The root of the problem is that when those factories caught fire, it also burned down the dormitories because they were part of the factory,"" said Hsu Wei-tung (許惟棟) of the migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT). ""So, we are here today calling for the MOL to mandate that dormitories be located away from the workplace to save the lives of migrant workers and firefighters.""Prior to the Taoyuan fire earlier this month, six Vietnamese migrant workers in Taoyuan City died in December 2017 in a factory fire that engulfed their dormitory, which was on the upper level of a factory warehouse made of sheet iron. The structure belonged to Sican Co., which runs a factory that produces solar control window film.Four months later, a blaze at a facility operated by Chin Poon, a printed circuit board factory in Taoyuan, claimed the lives of two Thai workers who were trapped in a dormitory on the factory premises, while six firefighters died in the rescue efforts.""The firefighters rushed into the burning factory because it was their duty to save lives,"" Chu Chih-yu (朱智宇), secretary general of the National Association for Firefighters' Rights, said at Tuesday's rally. ""But if people didn't live inside the factory, then the firefighters would not have had to put their lives on the line and enter the burning building.""The migrant workers at the rally, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, along with Taiwanese supporters, shouted slogans and burned incense at a makeshift altar in memory of those who had perished in the factory fires.A Filipino, who asked to be identified only as Arturo, said when he was working at a factory in Taoyuan last year, he was housed in a dorm in the basement of the building with nine coworkers.""There was once an earthquake and we felt extremely scared because there was only one exit from the basement. Imagine a fire -- we all would have been trapped,"" said Arturo, whose right hand was severed in a factory accident last year.Another Philippine worker said, however, that work safety is not the sole responsibility of the employer, and there is no guarantee that factory employees will be safe even if their dorms are offsite.""I have seen workers cooking in their rooms when they are not supposed to, plugging as many as 10 power adaptors to one outlet in the wall, and bringing cellphones into the work area,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named.Common sense is what is most important when it comes to safety, she said, adding that she works with toxic, flammable and combustible materials on a daily basis.In response to the protesters' calls, Huang Wei-cheng (黃偉誠), a section chief at the MOL's Workforce Development Agency, said the ministry is planning to amend the law to make it mandatory for factories that have onsite dorms to file safety reports, which would include a declaration of any pyrophoric substances or flammable gases on the site.The legislation, which is expected to be completed by June, will also state how often safety checks will be carried out at factories, according to a statement issued later by the MOL.Hsu, however, expressed skepticism about such safety checks, saying that there are some 100,000 dormitories throughout Taiwan for migrant workers, while the number of inspectors responsible for checking on the welfare of the workers totals only 274.""Work safety and the general welfare checks are usually carried out once, when a migrant worker first arrives in Taiwan, due to a lack of manpower,"" Hsu said.Among the 719,847 migrant workers in Taiwan, 455,934 are employed in the industrial sector, according to MOL statistics valid as of the end of February.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310011

3/31/2020,Transgender activists release 7 policy demands,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Activists marked Tuesday's International Transgender Day of Visibility by announcing seven policy demands based on what they called the largest-ever survey of Taiwan's transgender community.At a press conference, the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) announced the results of the survey, which was open to respondents who identify as transgender under the broad definition of the term -- those whose gender identities or expressions differ from what is typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.The survey, which was conducted online March 14-25, received 518 valid responses, which served as the basis for the seven policy proposals, the TAPCPR said.The alliance's first two demands were to end the practice of requiring sex reassignment surgery for people seeking to change the gender designation on their national identification cards, as well as allowing coverage of elective sex reassignment surgeries under Taiwan's National Health Insurance program.According to a 2013 report on Taiwan's implementation of human rights by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the former requirement could constitute a form of torture, the group said.These concerns were further borne out in survey results, the TAPCPR said, in which 30.42 percent of the respondents said they were unsure about the safety of such surgeries, 29.54 percent doubted their necessity and 52.3 percent considered them prohibitively expensive.In its third and fourth demands, meanwhile, the group called for acceptance of the transgender community's collective diversity and for reforms of Taiwan's gender designation policies based on consultations with the transgender community.As an example of this diversity, the group cited survey results showing that 52 percent of the respondents identified as either male or female, while 48 percent identified themselves as nonbinary, gender-fluid or agender.Given the complexity of gender identity revealed in the survey results, the government should abandon the poorly received ""third gender policy"" it proposed in 2017, and instead should adopt new guidelines based on consultations with the transgender community, the alliance said.Fifth, the alliance called for an abolition of legal distinctions between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages.Because Taiwan's marriage equality law was passed as a special act rather than a revision of the Civil Code, which governs opposite-sex marriage, the legal rights enjoyed by the two forms of marriage vary, with a disproportionate impact on transgender individuals, the group said.For example, if a person married under the Civil Code seeks to change their gender designation and have their marriage recognized under the marriage equality act, they lose the right to adopt children as a couple and can only adopt their partner's biological children as a step-parent, the group said.On a broader social level, the alliance recommended starting gender identity education beginning in elementary school as a way of pre-empting the experience of the 47.68 percent of survey respondents who said they were bullied, discriminated against or otherwise mistreated at school.Similarly, the government should include transgender people in its monitoring of hate crimes, given that 37.3 percent of those surveyed said they had suffered workplace discrimination, the alliance said.Overall, the survey respondents reported suffering a wide range of social difficulties related to their gender identification.These included 55.41 percent who feared discrimination in public restrooms, 24.32 percent who delayed or avoided medical treatment and 22.01 percent who had been discriminated against while shopping for clothes or accessories.Another 18.53 percent said they had been sexually harassed or attacked in public, while 15.83 percent were afraid to call the police in an emergency, according to the survey results.(By Yang Su-min and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310015
3/31/2020,Constitutional Court hears debate on decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Grand justices heard arguments at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday on whether a criminal law that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after several judges asked for an interpretation of the law.Article 239 of Taiwan's Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.Eighteen judges and a male who was convicted of adultery have asked the Constitutional Court in recent years to overturn Interpretation 554, which determined that Article 239 was constitutional.The most recent one was a judge surnamed Chen (陳) from the Miaoli District Court who mainly hears cases related to ""offenses against marriage,"" who felt Article 239 may violate the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan).The court finally agreed to hear the case and heard arguments Tuesday, some of which centered around Interpretation 554.The interpretation, which was made in 2002, ruled that the freedom of sexual behavior is inseparably related to the personality of individuals, and every person is free to decide whether or not and with whom to have sexual affairs.Such freedom is, however, legally protected only if it is not detrimental to the social order or public interest as provided in Article 22 of the Constitution, and therefore the freedom of sexual behavior is subject to the restriction put on it by marriage and the family system, the ruling said.One of the judges arguing for decriminalization, Wu Chih-chiang (吳志強), said adultery is not the only factor that shakes a marriage and therefore there was no need to intervene with ""national punishment.""He argued that Article 239 could lead to unfairness and inequality in administering punishment, forcing people to maintain an unwanted marriage.Wu was referring to complaints by supporters of the decriminalization of adultery that under Article 239 the crime of adultery cannot be prosecuted without a complaint by the victim, and if one spouse withdraws charges against the other, the withdrawal does not apply to the outside party.That has led in practice to women likely to be pressured by their husbands to drop the charges against them during the proceedings, yet the cases against the mistresses go ahead.Judge Chang Yuan-sen (張淵森) argued that the purpose of criminalizing adultery was to protect the family and social morals and prevent people from suffering in a miserable marriage.Yet while the law gives people the ability to get married and divorced freely, it cannot use criminal law to ""threaten"" people into acting faithfully in a marriage, he contended.Many factors cause suffering in a marriage, including the relationship between the wife and her mother-in-law, child education problems, financial issues, and sexual relations, Chang said.""If one person suffers in a marriage, it does not mean the other party has to be punished. Suffering should not be a reason for punishment in the Criminal Code,"" he said.Chi Hui-jung (紀惠容), a former executive director of the Garden of Hope Foundation who attended the Constitutional Court as a friend of the court to present her opinions, called Article 239 a law that punishes women.Although there are more men charged for adultery than women, in the end more women, most of them the mistresses in the cases, are convicted, she said.At the same time, she argued, the crime of adultery uses the Criminal Code to deter people from having affairs, but in a society that now frowns on using corporal punishment to discipline children, it is inappropriate to use ""threats"" to keep marriages together.Deputy Minister of Justice Tsai Pi-chung (蔡碧仲) argued, however, that the criminalization of adultery is aimed at safeguarding the marriage and family system.To support her position, Tsai cited Interpretation No. 544, which says the root of the nation's marital system lies in the freedom of personality, with such social functions as the maintenance of the order of human relationships and gender equality, and the raising of children.To insure an enduring and unimpaired system of marriage, the state may of course enact relevant rules to require a husband and wife to be mutually bound to each other by the duty of faithfulness, the interpretation says.The freedoms of individuals should still be restricted by the need to maintain social order, Tsai argued, and therefore Article 239 is not unconstitutional.(By Lin Chang-shun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310016
3/31/2020,Prosecutors voice support for decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310017

3/31/2020,Taiwan's surgical mask output hits 13 million per day,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's daily surgical mask output has hit 13 million, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Tuesday.The current daily output is more than four times the amount that Taiwan was capable of producing in early February, when Taiwan produced an average of 3.2 million surgical masks per day.That amount, however, is far from enough to meet the demand for surgical masks, which are widely used in Taiwan to prevent against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.In response to the high demand, the government banned the export of all surgical masks in late January, requisitioned all domestically produced masks, and instituted a rationing system to limit the number of masks people could buy per week.It also purchased 92 mask production lines, which have been set up in 40 days and have largely contributed to the significant surge in output.With the increase in output, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced Monday that people would be able to buy more masks under the rationing system in April.From April 9, residents will have access to nine masks for adults every 14 days, up from three per week at present, while the quota for children's masks will remain at 10 every two weeks, the CECC said.The MOEA is also discussing whether to purchase production lines that can produce N95 masks, which are able to filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles and are mainly used by medical workers on the frontlines.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310020

At present the United States is the worst hit with 159,184 confirmed cases, followed by 101,739 in Italy, 85,195 in Spain, 81,518 in China, and 57,298 in Germany.The virus has resulted in 36,852 deaths, including 11,591 in Italy, 7,340 in Spain, 3,305 in China, 3,024 in France, and 2,945 in the United States, the data shows.(By Chen Yun-yu and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310021
3/31/2020,Taiwan thanks Pompeo for 'open support' of WHA bid,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday expressed gratitude to United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for his ""open support"" of Taiwan's efforts to participate in the World Health Assembly (WHA).On Monday, Pompeo said in a telephonic roundtable with American reporters that his office will do its best to help Taiwan gain an ""appropriate role"" in the WHA, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), according to a Voice of America report.Pompeo also said the State Department will ""fully comply"" with the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019, which was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump on March 26, the news report said.In response, Taiwan's foreign ministry said the U.S. government and Congress have shown ""strong support"" for Taiwan with ""concrete actions"" at a time when the COVID-19 coronavirus is spreading rapidly around the world.""MOFA sincerely thanks Secretary Pompeo for his open support for Taiwan's international participation,"" MOFA spokesperson Joanne Ou (歐江安) said at a regular press conference in Taipei. ""MOFA will continue to work with the U.S. and other like-minded countries to advance our shared values and common goals and deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership on the global stage.""The TAIPEI Act was first introduced in the U.S. Senate by Cory Gardner last May, with Republican Congressman John Curtis unveiling a similar version in the House of Representatives in October, amid Beijing's continued efforts to squeeze Taiwan's international space.The legislation was passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier this month and later signed into law by Trump.The Act calls on the U.S. government to further Taiwan-U.S. bilateral trade and economic relations, help Taiwan participate in international organizations, and strengthen Taiwan's partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific region and in the world, according to Ou.It also authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider altering its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious actions to undermine Taiwan's security and prosperity, she said.The Republic of China (Taiwan), a founding member of the WHO, was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.International support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.Taiwan has been trying to rejoin the WHO since 1997. From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was able to participate in the WHA as an observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" with Beijing's approval, as cross-Taiwan Strait relations were warmer at the time.Since 2017, however, the year after President Tai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) took office, the Chinese government has been blocking Taiwan's efforts to participate in the WHA, due to differences between Taipei and Beijing over the so called ""1992 Consensus.""The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China,"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310022
3/31/2020,U.S. military aircraft fly near Taiwan for 4th time this month,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A United States military aircraft was reported flying near Taiwan's southern airspace Tuesday, marking the fourth time this month a U.S. warplane had been spotted operating near the country.The U.S. Navy P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft was operating in the South China Sea, according to a flight chart posted on Twitter on Tuesday by Aircraft Spots, a military air movement tracker.Asked to comment, Taiwanese military spokesman Shih Shun-wen (史順文) did not directly confirm the movement, saying only that the nation's armed forces are closely monitoring the country's surrounding waters and airspace.Based on charts released by Aircraft Spots and Taiwan's own records, the latest incident was the fourth time in March that a U.S. warplane was found to have been operating near the nation's airspace.The previously three occurrences all happened last week: on March 25 by an EP-3E ARIES II reconnaissance aircraft, on March 26 by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber and a KC-135 tanker, and on March 27 by another B-52 bomber and an RC-135U reconnaissance aircraft.Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS McCampbell conducted operations in the Taiwan Strait on March 25, according to information released by the U.S. Pacific Fleet on its Facebook page.The U.S. military's frequent operations around Taiwan, both in the air and at sea in the past week are designed to show that the U.S. is continuing its monitoring of the region, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, local military analysts told CNA.Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), a section chief of the government-funded thinktank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), said the U.S. warplanes intentionally turned on their transponders so that their signals could be picked up by air movement trackers.In this way, it was sending a clear message tactically that it is closely watching the region despite the pandemic.These military movements might also be monitoring any moves made by their Chinese counterparts, he added.Lin Ying-yu (林穎佑), an assistant professor at National Chung Cheng University's Institute of Strategic and International Affairs, said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is apparently playing the ""anti-China/pro-Taiwan"" card by frequently sending warplanes and warships near Taiwan in the hope of gaining more voter support in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310023

3/31/2020,Taiwan's COVID-19 response could reach NT$1 trillion: premier,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The Taiwan government's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could reach as much as NT$1 trillion (US$33 billion), Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) told a legislative hearing on Tuesday.Such a figure would more adequately reflect the global nature of the crisis than the NT$60 billion special budget the Executive Yuan proposed in February, when the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was mainly limited to China, Su said.In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee De-wei (李德維) asked Su to detail the timing and scale of response measures being planned by the government, inquiring whether it would seek anything on the scale of Singapore's recently announced S$48 billion (US$33.65 billion) stimulus plan.""The overall scale will likely be around NT$1 trillion,"" Su said, arguing that the size of various countries' response measures will vary based on a variety of factors.In the United States, for example, people use private, rather than public insurance, while Taiwan uses the National Health Insurance program. Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202003310025

4/12/2020,127 European parliamentarians support Taiwan's WHA bid,"Taipei, April 12 (CNA) In a series of letters, 127 European parliamentarians have expressed support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwan's foreign ministry said Saturday.One of the letters, dated April 8 and addressed to European Union High Representative Josep Borrell, was signed by 67 EU parliamentarians from six party caucuses, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said.""The WHO treatment of Taiwan as part of China has caused problems for Taiwan,"" according to a copy of the letter that was posted on Twitter by one of the signatories, former Poland Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga.Not only is Taiwan's democratically elected government barred from participation in the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), but Taiwanese experts are also arbitrarily prevented from attending the WHO's technical meetings, the letter stated.""In these difficult times, the substantial cooperation in areas such as medical supplies, research and development of vaccines between Taiwan, the EU and its Member States would be beneficial in order to curb the further spread of the pandemic and better prepare for any future outbreak,"" the letter reads.One of the other letters was signed by 60 legislators of the German Parliament on April 2 and addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been heavily criticized by the U.S. and several other countries for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to MOFA.Anita Schäfer, chairperson of the German-Chinese Association-Friends of Taiwan, wrote in that letter that the WHO's treatment of Taiwan was inconsistent with its organizational values, MOFA said.The foreign ministry expressed appreciation for the support of the 127 European parliamentarians, saying they were the ""voice of justice.""The empathy of those parliamentarians for Taiwan is in sharp contrast to Tedros' biased statements about Taiwan, MOFA said.Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist, should be impartial and professional on the matter of the Taiwanese people's health and welfare, MOFA said.Since Taiwan was expelled from the WHO in 1972, its participation in the WHA as an observer has been limited to an eight-year period, from 2009 to 2016, amid relatively warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations during that time.International support for Taiwan's bid to rejoin in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.(By Chen Yun-yu and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202004120001

5/17/2020,Doyen of Taiwan's nativist literature movement passes away at 96,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) A doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement"" Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政) passed away at his home in Taoyuan City Saturday, according to his family. He was 96.Chung's son Chung Yen-wei (鍾延威) told reporters that the family found Chung not breathing around 7 p.m. Saturday.Chung Yen-wei said despite his father's old age, he was in relative stable health over the years. The family is deeply saddened and shocked by Chung's sudden passing and is now preparing his funeral.Born in Taoyuan's Longtan district in 1925 during Japanese rule, Chung was widely considered the doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement,"" who was most famous for his works, ""The Dull Ice Flower (魯冰花),"" ""the Turbid Waters Trilogy"" (濁流三部曲) and ""the Taiwanese Trilogy"" (台灣人三部曲).His classics of Taiwanese literature depicts the lives and fates of Taiwanese against the background of post-World War II Taiwan, following the end of the Japanese colonial period.In mourning the passing of Chung, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) expressed condolence to his family and said the passing of the nonagenarian literati is a great loss to the nation's literary circle.In a Facebook post, Tsai also praised Chung, an ethnic Hakka, for playing an import role in promoting Hakka culture and Taiwanese literature.Chung and other writers of his time had jointly published a regular newsletter in the post WWII era, the Literary Bulletin -- a periodical that proved essential to young and aspiring writers of that time, according to Tsai.Tsai said she will always remember Chung as an elder who saw her as his own child. She pledged to bear Chung's teaching in mind to continue the promotion of Hakka and Taiwanese culture so that Chung's legacy will last for generations to come.Asked to comment on Chung's legacy, writer Chen Fang-ming (陳芳明) told CNA that Chung had a tremendous impact toward the development of Taiwanese literature.Chung had played an crucial rule during the transitional period in the 1950s after the Kuomintang (KMT) had just taken over the governing of Taiwan from Japan at the end of Japanese colonial rule, according to Chen.Sincere condolences on the passing of #Hakka literary master Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政). The esteemed writer passed away on May 16 at the age of 96. https://t.co/zUbiiwwuCE pic.twitter.com/PH02BDFO0WAt that time, most Taiwanese could only speak Japanese and very few people could speak Mandarin, let alone write in the Chinese language. Chung was one of a handful of native Taiwanese writers of that time that can.Aside from focusing on his own works, Chung also published the Literary Bulletin that offered a platform for Taiwanese writers to publish their works.Chung's works had faithfully recorded the everyday lives of Taiwanese people of his time which showed his deep connection and affection toward his homeland, Chen noted.The Hakka Affairs Council, meanwhile, remembered Chung as not only a prolific writer but a devoted promoter of Hakka affairs who helped promote the awareness of Hakka culture to a national level, which successfully led to the creation in the 1990s of a dedicated Hakka language radio station.(By Chiu Chun-chin, Su Lung-chi Chen Ping-hung, Wu Hsin-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005170003

Taiwan will raise its retail gasoline and diesel prices by NT$0.9 per liter, effective midnight Sunday, the company said.After the increase, prices at CPC gas stations will be NT$19.1 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$20.6 per liter for 95 unleaded, NT$22.6 per liter for 98 unleaded, and NT$16.3 per liter for super diesel, CPC said.The latest price hikes came after international oil prices rose this past week because of the gradual stabilization of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world and news that Saudi Arabia would further cut oil production in June.CPC adjusts its fuel prices weekly based on changes in crude oil prices, using a weighted oil price formula composed of 70 percent Dubai crude and 30 percent Brent crude.Based on that formula, the price of crude rose US$3.36 over the past week from US$24.87 per barrel to US$28.23 per barrel, the company said.Meanwhile, CPC's main competitor, Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC), announced identical price hikes Sunday, to take effect at 1 a.m. Monday.After the adjustments, prices at FPCC gas stations will be NT$19.1 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$20.5 per liter for 95 octane unleaded, NT$22.6 per liter for 98 octane unleaded, and NT$16.1 per liter for diesel.(By Pan Tzu-yu and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005170004

The last time Taiwan recorded a domestic infection was on April 12.The lack of cases has led to a gradual loosening of restrictions that have been in place, and Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC, said at a daily briefing that special entertainment establishments could reopen under certain circumstances.The establishments, such as hostess KTVs and hostess dance clubs, would have to adopt social distancing guidelines, and customers and staff members would need to wear masks and have their temperatures checked and use hand sanitizer before entering the premise, Chen said.A system will also have to be in place that allows the businesses to reach customers after they have left, Chen said.""If the local governments can ensure these measures, then we can start re-opening these establishments,"" Chen said.Since the outbreak of COVID-19 late last year, Taiwan has recorded 440 cases, 349 of which have been classified as imported and 55 as local infections, according to CECC statistics.The other 36 cases are a cluster infection on a Navy vessel that returned April 9 from a Pacific goodwill mission. Those cases have not yet been classified as either local or imported, CECC data showed.To date, 395 COVID-19 patients in Taiwan have recovered, seven have died, with the remainder are still hospitalized, the CECC said in a statement.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 4,660,752 people in 187 countries and regions, including 1,489,642 in the United States, 272,043 in Russia, 240,161 in the United Kingdom, 230,698 in Spain and 224,760 in Italy, with a total of 311,064 fatalities, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.(By William Yen) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005170005
5/17/2020,Hostess club in Tainan reopens to customers amid COVID-19,"Tainan, May 17 (CNA) A hostess dance club in Tainan reopened Saturday, becoming the first such club in Taiwan's six major metropolitan areas to restart business after being shut down last month because of fears it could easily spread COVID-19.Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) said the city government issued a business resumption permit to the Wan Hsiang Dance Club (萬象舞廳) Friday after the club passed a government inspection.The 35-year-old Wan Hsiang Dance Club is so far the only legitimate hostess club among the five in the southern Taiwan city that has applied to reopen, according to Huang.City government officials said owners of the club pledged to implement the Central Epidemic Command Center's (CECC's) epidemic prevention guidelines against COVID-19 as it reopens its doors to customers.These guidelines include asking customers to follow social distancing measures, having them wear a face mask, taking their temperatures, and getting them to use hand sanitizer before entering the clubs.The club will also be required to control the flow of people by keeping a register of those entering, the city government said.The club's owners pledged to register the name and ID card numbers of each customer, and transparent plastic partitions have also been installed in each private booth to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Customers will also be forbidden to dance with a partner despite the resumption of operations, but will be allowed to dance alone, the club said, without elaborating.Huang said city officials will conduct inspections of the club to make sure it is following related guidelines, and the club will be closed for a week should violations be reported.Local media quoted the 75-year-old owner of the club surnamed Tseng (曾) as saying that the month-long suspension is the longest period of time the establishment has been closed during its 35-year history.The shutdown has seriously affected the livelihoods of the club's 100 employees and 200 hostesses, and they are all eager to see business resume, Tseng was cited as saying.The CECC on April 9 ordered hostess clubs across the country shut down, saying they posed a high risk of spreading COVID-19 after a hostess at a club in Taipei was confirmed to have the disease.As the number of cases dwindled to practically zero in the first week of May, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, announced on May 8 that local governments could decide whether to reopen their cities' hostess clubs under certain conditions.Tainan is the only one of Taiwan's six special municipalities -- which also include Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung -- to allow hostess bars to reopen so far.(By Chang Rong-hsiang and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005170006

5/17/2020,Taiwan advised to work with major economies after COVID-19,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan must seize the opportunity to work with major economies seeking to relocate global supply chains outside of China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic scholars suggested as President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) begins her second term on May 20.The pandemic, which has made many countries aware of their growing economic dependence on China for goods in several critical sectors, has led to calls to delink global supply chains of major industries from China.That trend offers an extremely good opportunity to Taiwan, said Ray Yang (楊瑞臨), consulting director of the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center (ISTI) under the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).He said the United States, China and Europe may all look to develop independent production capabilities in the post-COVID-19 world, and Taiwan has an opportunity to become an important partner for all of them.Yang said the U.S. will still be the world leader but cannot go it alone and will itself have to form partnerships with economies such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Taiwan is well positioned, Yang said, because the COVID-19 crisis has opened the world's eyes to the strengths of Taiwanese businesses, including their ability to respond quickly to different situations, high degree of flexibility and quality of manufactured goods.That was seen most clearly in Taiwan's ramping up of production of face masks and protective gear for medical workers to meet high demand during the coronavirus epidemic, he said.Meanwhile, Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, predicted that the U.S. economy would recover faster from the coronavirus pandemic than China.That trend has already prompted more Taiwanese businesses operating overseas to increase investment in Taiwan and reduce investment in China and other countries, Chiu said.Chiu also contended it will be in Taiwan's interests if the United States create an alliance of ""trusted partners"" to restructure supply chains away from China, as has been reported.According to a Reuters report in early May, the alliance would apply common standards for everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to trade, education and commerce, with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, India and Vietnam among potential partners.Though Taiwan is not on the list of ""trusted partners,"" it is a reasonable assumption that Taiwan has an opportunity to be included in the next phase given that Taiwan is considered a partner in the U.S.'s ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,"" Chiu said.""We must let the United States know that Taiwan can make its planned supply chains more complete,"" Chiu said, pointing to Taiwan's semiconductor industry's advantage in wafer fabrication and packaging and testing technology, which would help build the U.S.'s IC design capabilities.Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises' strength in producing spare parts and component production could also strengthen those new supply chains, Chiu said.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wu Po-wei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005170008

So that's a great event,"" said Fotland, fondly called ""Norwegian grandpa"" by many Taiwanese who know him.Oslo is usually not keen on promoting Taiwan due to Beijing's influence in recent years, but major newspapers in Norway started to mention Taiwan in May because of its good performance in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, he said.""Taiwan has shown the world that we are independent from COVID-19 while the rest of the world is occupied by COVID-19, as Norway.""Oslo cut its official ties with Taipei in January 1950.

What makes it special is not its size or the number of people in attendance. It is special because we know how difficult it has been for us to get to this point.I want to thank the people of Taiwan for making such a difficult feat possible.I particularly want to thank a group of people who have not received a lot of attention over the past four months in our fight against COVID-19. I want to thank every single person who waited in line outside of the pharmacy in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for trusting the government. You have shown the world Taiwan's commitment to civic virtues, even in times of greatest distress.I also want to thank everyone who was quarantined or isolated at home, putting up with inconvenience in your daily life to keep others safe and healthy. Thank you for exemplifying humanity's best qualities and helping us successfully bring the coronavirus outbreak under control.This sense of pride in our country, this community's shared destiny, and the memories of these past months will live on in all of our hearts. This is what solidarity feels like.Many ambassadors and representatives from other countries are here today, and I trust that many countries around the world are watching Taiwan as well.I want to take this opportunity to tell you that the country you see is populated by kind and resilient people. No matter the difficulties we face, we can always count on our democracy, our solidarity, and our sense of responsibility towards each other to help us overcome challenges, weather difficult times, and stand steadfast in the world.From January to now, Taiwan has amazed the international community twice. The first was our democratic elections, and the second was our success in the fight against COVID-19.In recent months, Taiwan's name has appeared in headlines around the world, thanks to our successful containment of the coronavirus outbreak.""Taiwan"" is also emblazoned on the boxes of supplies we are sending abroad. The Taiwanese people have the kindest hearts in the entire world, and we will always offer help to the international community whenever we are able.I hope that in addition to sharing in a sense of pride and joy, my fellow citizens can take to heart the spirit of ""helping ourselves to help others;"" ""when we help ourselves, others will help us.""This pandemic has not yet ended, and we must remain vigilant. Even when it ends, its impacts will linger on.The coronavirus has profoundly affected our world. It has changed the global political and economic order, accelerated and expanded the reorganization of global supply chains, restructured the global economy, and changed the way we live and shop. It has even changed the way the international community views Taiwan and developments in the surrounding region.These changes present us with both challenges and opportunities. I want to ask that my fellow citizens be prepared, because countless challenges and difficulties remain ahead of us.Over the next four years, only those who can end the pandemic within their borders, lay out a strategy for their country's survival and development, and take advantage of opportunities in the complex world of tomorrow, will be able to set themselves apart on the international stage.It takes more than fervor to govern a country. Leadership means calmly taking the right direction in a changing world. That is precisely what I have done over the past four years.I said before that I will leave you with a better country. So over the next four years, I will proactively develop our industries, foster a safe society, ensure national security, and deepen our democracy. I am going to reinvent Taiwan and lead our country into the future.1. Industrial and Economic DevelopmentI know that the Taiwanese people are most concerned about our industrial and economic development. In 2016, we initiated a new economic development model to help connect Taiwan's economy to the world. Over the past four years, despite massive changes in the international economy, Taiwan has done more than just weather the storm. Our economic growth has once again topped the Four Asian Tigers, and the stock market index now regularly breaks 10,000 points.Thanks to our successful control of the pandemic, so far, Taiwan is able to maintain positive economic growth. This is rare in the world. However, we need to continue to take early action on economic relief and revitalization, and do whatever it takes to maintain stable economic growth.Over the next four years, we will face more intense changes in the global economy and the accelerated reorganization of supply chains. We will continue to implement our Forward-looking Infrastructure Development and trillion NT-dollar investment programs. We will do so in the spirit of ""achieving growth through stability, and seizing opportunity amid changes,"" in order to secure Taiwan's economic development over the coming decades.In terms of industrial development, we are going to take advantage of the opportunities before us in six core strategic industries founded on our 5+2 Innovative Industries Program, to transform Taiwan into a critical force in the global economy.First, we will continue to develop our information and digital industries. We will take advantage of Taiwan's strengths in the semiconductor and ICT industries to secure a central role in global supply chains, and make Taiwan a major base for the development of next generation technologies, including IoT and AI.Second, we are going to develop a cybersecurity industry that can integrate with 5G, digital transformation, and our national security. We will strive to create cybersecurity systems and an industrial chain that can protect our country and earn the world's trust.Third, we are going to create biotech and medical technology industries integrated with the rest of the world. Throughout this pandemic, Taiwanese teams have proven that they are capable of working with world-class technologies to produce reagents and develop new drugs and vaccines. We are going to give these industries our utmost support, and transform Taiwan into a key force in the global battle against infectious diseases.Fourth, we are going to develop national defense and strategic industries by integrating military and civilian capabilities. In addition to domestically-produced naval vessel and aircraft programs that are currently underway, we will push harder to promote technological integration between the military and the private sector, to stimulate private sector production capabilities, and advance into the aviation and space industries.Fifth, we are going to accelerate the development of green energy and renewable energy industries. Over the past four years, renewable energy has experienced explosive growth, and Taiwan has become a hotspot for international investment. Building on this foundation, I am confident that we will achieve our goal of deriving 20% of our overall energy from green sources by 2025. We are going to make Taiwan a center for green energy in Asia.Sixth, we are going to establish strategic stockpile industries that can ensure the steady provision of critical supplies. Facing changes to the global order, we need to keep key industrial chains in Taiwan and maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the production of face masks, medical and daily supplies, energy, and food.In the current international climate, countries that end their dependence on others will have a head start on national development. I would like our friends across all industries to rest assured that our government stands with you. Over the next few years, we have several strategies to drive the growth of our industries.First, we will use domestic demand, particularly demand from the public sector and national security needs, as the basic engine for our industrial development.A prime example of this is the way strategic demand for face masks and other medical supplies throughout this pandemic has spurred the development of related industries. We can adopt a similar model for our national defense and renewable energy industries to help accelerate their development.We will continue to organize ""national teams,"" like our face mask team, according to the size and conditions of different industries. We will utilize our government's guarantee of domestic demand to establish a global strategic materials manufacturing industry under the ""Taiwanese brand"" and help it expand into other markets.We know that financial support is crucial to industrial development. Looking to the future, we will adopt more flexible financial policies, continue to reform financial systems, and use more diverse means to help industries obtain the financing they need.We will also work to create a safe environment for our industries. Our government is committed to maintaining sound public health and national security systems, a stable society, strong rule of law, and a healthy market. We need to offer these guarantees so that high-tech and strategic industries will be willing to choose Taiwan as their production and R&D base.We will also continue to guide the global expansion of our industries. We will keep working to sign trade or investment protection agreements with the United States, Japan, and European countries.As we continue to promote our New Southbound Policy, we will also develop other potential markets and encourage firms to establish operations there, giving our industries an edge when they engage in international cooperation. Overseas Taiwanese business communities around the world will be our best partners as we seek new international opportunities.Finally, we have the issue of talent. In order for Taiwan to become a key global economic force, we need a diverse talent pool. My government will bring in the world's top technical, R&D, and management talents to help globalize Taiwan's workforce, widen our industries' horizons, and give them the ability to compete in the international arena.Looking to the future, Taiwan must further connect with the international community. We will work to cultivate more outstanding bilingual and digital talents, giving our industries a global competitive edge.Over the next four years, Taiwan's economy will enter a new stage, complete with more flexible capital and talent flows, more robust industrial capabilities, and closer ties with the world. Together, we are going to enter a new era of shared prosperity.2. Safe Society: Health and Social Safety Nets to Catch Those Who Need HelpAs we develop our industries, we will also keep in mind that the people expect the government to foster a safe society. To be a better country, the government must take on more responsibilities to reduce the burden on the people and mitigate issues in society.Over the past few years, we have addressed Long-term Care 2.0, childcare, and residential justice issues. Over the next four years, my goal is to weave an even tighter net that can catch every single person who needs help and prevent future tragedies.●Health and Disease Prevention Safety NetFirst, we will strengthen our health and disease prevention safety net. Taiwan is an ageing society, and infectious diseases pose a serious challenge to the health of our people. That is why we need to bolster our disease prevention and treatment capabilities and link industries to make more breakthroughs in vaccine and new drug development, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, so that people can enjoy healthy lives and receive better care.●Mending Gaps in the Social Safety NetOur second step will be to mend the gaps in our social safety net. Over the past few years, a great deal of discussion has arisen around public safety incidents involving schizophrenia patients. The same goes for other mental illnesses, drug addiction, and domestic violence.I understand your concerns. These issues are not just the responsibility of individuals or families, they are the responsibility of the government. When families are unable to provide proper care, the government has a duty to step in and help.I am going to upgrade our social care system, enhance the capabilities of frontline social workers, and improve their work environments, so that they can work at the grassroots and identify people who have fallen through the gaps in our safety net.We cannot hold medical agencies or individual judges solely responsible for controversies surrounding specific cases. Our judicial and executive branches should reevaluate and optimize these systems and take initiatives to make any necessary legal amendments.3. National Security: National Defense Reforms, Active International Participation, Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsA better country requires a greater emphasis on national security. Over the past four years, we have pushed for national defense reforms, active international participation, and peaceful, stable cross-strait relations. We hope that Taiwan can play a more active role in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Over the next four years, the direction of our policies will remain the same, and we will do even more.●National Defense ReformsWe have three important directions for our national defense reforms. First is accelerating the development of our asymmetrical capabilities. While we work to bolster our defense capabilities, future combat capacity development will also emphasize mobility, countermeasures, and non-traditional asymmetrical capabilities. We will also work to strengthen our defenses against the threats of cyber warfare, cognitive warfare, and ""unrestricted"" warfare to achieve our strategic goal of multidomain deterrence.The second is substantive reforms to our military reserve and mobilization systems. We need to enhance the quality of our reserve forces, as well as their weapons, equipment, and training, in order to achieve effective jointness with our regular forces. We also need to establish a standing, interdepartmental system connecting our reserve and mobilization systems. This system will help coordinate personnel and supplies, so that we can successfully mobilize during a transition from peacetime to war.Third is improvements to our military's management institutions. Today's young servicemembers have all grown up in a democratic society, and one of our most important missions will be to find ways for them to better utilize their professional skills in line with military needs.Some young servicemembers have difficulties adjusting to military needs, reflecting the gap between today's society and our military management institutions. We need to work to close that gap. We need to reduce negative societal views of the military and end the gradual erosion of our military's prestige and morale due to individual incidents caused by imperfect institutions.Thus, we will improve appeal and counseling mechanisms within the military, establish a fair and equitable incident investigation mechanism, and regularly evaluate personnel placements. In terms of education and training, we will strengthen leadership capacities across all levels of leadership and foster a modern management system that emphasizes professionalism.We need to strike a balance between the team-oriented military discipline needed for actual combat and society's respect for the individual.●Active International ParticipationOver the past four years, we have actively taken part in addressing major global issues, including counter-terrorism cooperation, humanitarian assistance, religious freedom, and nontraditional security.Throughout this global pandemic, we have been praised for providing selfless assistance to the international community wherever we are able.Taiwan has been deemed a democratic success story, a reliable partner, and a force for good in the world by the international community. All Taiwanese people should take pride in this.Over the next four years, we will continue to fight for our participation in international organizations, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with our allies, and bolster ties with the United States, Japan, Europe, and other like-minded countries.We will also participate more actively in regional cooperation mechanisms and work hand-in-hand with countries in the region to make concrete contributions to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.●Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsIn the face of complex and changing cross-strait circumstances, we have made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait over the past four years, gaining approval from the international community. We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security.Here, I want to reiterate the words ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue."" We will not accept the Beijing authorities' use of ""one country, two systems"" to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle.We will continue to handle cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. This has been our consistent position for maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Cross-strait relations have reached a historical turning point. Both sides have a duty to find a way to coexist over the long term and prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences. Faced with changing circumstances, I will hold firm to my principles, adopt an open attitude to resolve issues, and shoulder my responsibilities as President. I also hope that the leader on the other side of the Strait will take on the same responsibility, and work with us to jointly stabilize the long-term development of cross-strait relations.While we work to achieve national development, it is crucial that we optimize our government institutions over the next four years. Our Legislative Yuan will establish a constitutional amendment committee, giving us a platform to engage in dialogue and reach a consensus on constitutional reforms pertaining to government systems and people's rights.This democratic process will enable the constitutional system to progress with the times and align with the values of Taiwanese society. Our first priority should be to lower the voting age from 20 to 18, an issue on which both the majority and opposition parties are in agreement.In terms of judicial reform, I delivered on my promise to convene a National Congress on Judicial Reform, and we completed amendments to the Judges Act, the Attorney Regulation Act, the Constitutional Court Procedure Act, and the Labor Incident Act. This is all base work for the further improvement of our judicial system.However, our judicial reforms are still in transition, and our current progress has not yet met the public's expectations. I will continue to solicit opinions from across society and keep pressing forward. The people's dissatisfaction drives us to continue on the path of reform.Within the next four years, we need to implement a lay judge system, so that citizens can act as lay judges in court and become catalysts for judicial reform. This will help bridge the distance between the people and our judicial system, so that it aligns better with their expectations and earns their trust.All constitutional institutions must also continue on the path of reform. The Executive Yuan will reevaluate and reinitiate its organizational reform process, including the establishment of a specialized digital development agency and adjustments to all ministries in line with current needs. This will enable governance capabilities to be more responsive to the needs of national development.The National Human Rights Commission under the Control Yuan will officially be established in August of this year. This will be a milestone in our journey to place human rights at the center of Taiwan's national ethos, and marks the start of a new chapter for the Control Yuan.Our new Examination Yuan team will be instated in September, and I will ask them to propose a comprehensive reform plan and evaluate past policies, so that they can become an effective human resource department that can cultivate the talent a modern government needs.My fellow citizens, over the past 70 years, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has grown more resilient and unified through countless challenges. We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation. We have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Although we were once isolated in the world, we have always persisted in the values of democracy and freedom, no matter the challenges ahead of us. We will always remain committed to our common belief: Taiwan must help ourselves to help others, and when we help ourselves, others will help us.Many of the heroes in our fight against COVID-19 are here with us today, including members of our national face mask team, our Central Epidemic Command Center's public health team, and Premier Su Tseng-chang's team.There are many more heroes from all walks of life not in attendance today: medical workers, postal workers, pharmacists, convenience store clerks, taxi drivers, and many more.I may not be able to call out all of your names, but I want everyone to know that Taiwan has overcome countless challenges over the past 70 years, relying on not just one or two heroes, but thanks to countless heroes such as yourselves, working together to turn the wheels of history. You have helped make Taiwan a happy, safe, and prosperous place for generations to come.I want to express my respect to all of you. Every single person in Taiwan is a hero. Vice President Lai and I are honored to take on the responsibility you have entrusted to us.Taking on the responsibility of the President of the Republic of China in such difficult times brings me more pressure than joy. But I will not back down, because all of you are with me.The path forward will not be easy, and greater challenges await us. But we are a country that has persevered through even the greatest hardships. We, the 23 million people, have always been and will always be a community with a shared destiny.I truly hope that all of my fellow citizens will remember how it felt to come together to overcome the challenges of the past few months. The Republic of China can be united. Taiwan can be safe. Being Taiwanese can be an honor that makes you hold your head high.My dear citizens, the path ahead of us is long, and we are about to begin a new chapter in Taiwan's story. Taiwan's story belongs to each and every one of us, and it needs each and every one of us.I ask that the 23 million people of Taiwan act as our guides and partners. Let us pool our wisdom and courage and make this country a better place together. Thank you.（For the full text in Mandarin: 最特別的就職典禮 蔡總統：感謝台灣人民【演說全文】）",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005200003

5/22/2020,A new 'internet for everything' era on the way: expert,"By Kay Liu, CNA staff writerThe global COVID-19 pandemic has upended people's lives, giving terms such as stay at home, work from home, and social distancing added resonance and accentuating the importance of the internet in connecting with others and doing one's job.What many are wondering is if these lifestyle changes will become entrenched and workplaces permanently altered even as the pandemic eases and people can move freely again.Kenny Huang, the chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), says the trends are here to stay, and he foresees a world of ""internet for everything,"" in which even more tasks will be done online.""Before the pandemic, the internet was an information technology tool. For businesses, it was used to help with operations, marketing or other areas. But in the post-COVID-19 era, all business activities will likely be connected to the internet,"" Huang said in a recent interview with CNA.Huang is in as good a position as anybody to look into the future of cyberspace.His TWNIC, which manages domain names ending with .tw and internet protocol (IP) addresses in Taiwan, routinely conducts surveys and issues reports on internet use that offer insights into trends and developments in the online world and help businesses make decisions.He believes COVID-19 has already made the internet part of a new reality because people no longer feel that things have to be done face-to-face, at least judging by the surge in online traffic and bandwidth he has observed from Dec. 30, 2019 to March 23.Huang estimates that the internet is used in about 10 percent of everyday work at present, but he expects that to go much higher in the future as habits change.Possible risksThe increasingly internet-dependent world that Huang envisions could have a downside, however, with risks that already exist such as threats to cybersecurity or the monopolization of information potentially magnified, he said.He pointed to the possibility of a wider spread of disinformation if people become more reliant on digital media as a news source.""There are always new solutions, but there will always be new types of disruptions,"" said Huang, who used the example of fake news evolving from pure fiction to mixing in some facts to create misinformation.The new solutions, he said, are the likes of the review mechanism introduced by Facebook and Twitter and the work of organizations such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center.Social mediaSocial media could also fall prey to the growing importance of the internet, Huang suggested.At its core, the internet is about transmitting data and connecting devices, while social media plays the role of ""connecting people, who share and exchange the knowledge and views they have,"" he said.Interactions online may mirror those in the real world, but they are not perfect reflections, he said.They could become even more imperfect as reliance on the internet means users gravitate to only a few major service providers, and those platforms' user agreement and rules become, in effect, the rules of society, Huang cautioned.According to the center's annual Taiwan Internet Report for 2019, 79.2 percent of those surveyed between September and November last year used online social media, of whom 98.9 percent used Facebook, 38.8 percent used Instagram and only 5.6 percent used Twitter.Security concernsBehind the changing of habits seen during the global pandemic, the introduction of fifth generation wireless technology (5G) could also profoundly affect user habits by offering accessible, fast internet access at an affordable price.But its arrival has posed a challenge to Taiwan's government that may dominate the debate over cyberspace in the post-COVID-19 world -- balancing an open ecosystem with security concerns.In terms of 5G, the existing internet environment could make it easy for just a few companies to become dominant players, and they may be foreign and even hostile to Taiwan's interests. That has led Taiwan's government to intervene in the 5G arena by banning the use of essential equipment from certain suppliers or countries, especially China, on the grounds of national security, Huang said.Such fears have extended into other areas, including to internet services, he said, citing the example of China-based video-conferencing service Zoom, which has soared in popularity during the pandemic but was banned in Taiwan for government and school use over security concerns.Yet the government has not been as interventionist in other social or commercial domains, Huang said, citing the example of the growing popularity of foreign online streaming services that are full of content from China.The TWNIC report found that 84.5 percent of those surveyed watched online video or streamed content, 76.3 percent of which was produced in Taiwan, followed by China (42.2 percent), the United States (38.2 percent), Japan (35.2 percent), South Korea (34.4 percent) and Europe (13.2 percent).Striking a balance between free speech and China's attempts to use cultural power to spread its message in Taiwan will not be easy for the government, Huang said.Personal protectionMeanwhile, Huang warned that we all, at some level, will have to be prepared for the pitfalls of being heavily reliant on the online world.Shutdowns of service ""have happened and could still happen, and the impact on us will only increase because the time we spend and our reliance on internet services is growing,"" he said.""When using online services, people need to think ahead and have a plan B in case a company shuts down operations. Everyone should back up data routinely, update online accounts, update passwords, and not allow cookies when browsing online when they are not necessary,"" he advised.Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005220009

5/22/2020,Global support for Taiwan at record high: former U.S. official,"Washington, May 21 (CNA) Randall G. Schriver, a former United States assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said Thursday that Taiwan has won huge global support because of its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, despite China's suppression.""Taiwan's international recognition, international admiration for Taiwan, international support for Taiwan has almost never been higher, because we see the juxtaposition of how the PRC has handled the coronavirus and how Taiwan has,"" Schriver said at a virtual conference hosted by the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.Schriver also berated China for poaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies and seeking to exclude Taiwan from global bodies like the World Health Organization.The Communist Party of China's ""approach to Taiwan has failed, not by my measure but by their own measure,"" he said in the forum, titled U.S.-Taiwan Relations and Taiwan's Evolving Role in the Global Order.As a result of China's failed policies, it has destroyed any pathway for what it calls peaceful reunification and any remaining constituency for a future ""one China,"" Schriver said.China's proposed 'one country, two systems' unification framework ""never had much of a constituency in Taiwan, but polls now regarding what aspirations people have for a future arrangement ... have never been worse from China's perspective,"" he said. ""So it is very difficult to see re-sinification of Taiwan through peaceful means.""In light of that situation, Schriver said, the U.S. should be concerned about a growing temptation on the part of China to use more military tools and coercion against Taiwan.Under such circumstances, the U.S. and Taiwan should strengthen cooperation in the field of information sharing, he said, adding that he supports U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to help boost its defense capability.Also at the forum, Evan Medeiros, Penner Family chair in Asian studies and the Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations, said it is becoming more difficult for the U.S. to strike a balance in supporting Taiwan while seeking to build a constructive relationship with China, given that China is growing more confident in East Asia, and Taiwan is facing increasing pressure and coercion from Beijing.Medeiros said the U.S. should take its security pledge to Taiwan seriously, sell Taiwan more weapons based on the Taiwan Relations Act, and help Taiwan join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Chin-yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005220011
5/22/2020,"Government, opposition condemn China plans for new HK security laws","Taipei, May 22 (CNA) Taiwan's government and leading opposition party spoke out Friday against plans by the Chinese government to enact new national security laws in Hong Kong.At a press conference Thursday, Chinese officials announced that the National People's Congress, China's Legislature, would review a bill ""on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard national security.""While the text of the legislation has yet to be released, Chinese state media signaled that it will provide legal grounds for the central government to intervene against activities in Hong Kong it deems subversive to state power.In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday that the proposed legislation demonstrates the Chinese government's inability to reflect on the true causes of dissatisfaction in Hong Kong, as it instead seeks to blame its problems on foreign interference and independence activists.Alex Huang (黃重諺), a spokesperson for Taiwan's Presidential Office, called on Beijing to respect Hong Kongers' legitimate democratic aspirations and to enter into dialogue with them, rather than further restricting their freedoms.Both of Taiwan's major political parties also issued statements condemning the legislation.Hung Yu-chien (洪于茜), a spokesperson for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said Taiwanese people across party lines are concerned about the situation in Hong Kong and called on Beijing to respect the region's autonomy.The proposed legislation will bypass Hong Kong's Legislature and violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration's guarantee of autonomy for the region, Hung went on, adding that Hong Kong people's distrust of Beijing, which led to major protest movements in 2014 and 2019, would only be exacerbated by the plans.As far as the KMT is concerned, the Republic of China (Taiwan's formal name) is a sovereign country, and the ""one country, two systems"" model espoused by China is absolutely not on the table, Hung said.The governing Democratic Progressive Party, meanwhile, said the plans made it possible that anyone in Hong Kong could end up as the next Lee Ming-che (李明哲), and ""declared again to the world that 'one country, two systems' is dead.""Lee, a Taiwanese pro-democracy activist, disappeared in March 2017 after entering China from Macau and was subsequently jailed for ""subverting state power.""In an opening address to the People's Congress on Friday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克强) said the country would continue to oppose Taiwan independence and promote reunification with China.(By Yu Hsiang, Wen Kuei-hsiang and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005220012

5/22/2020,Few mentions of Taiwan in annual speech by Chinese premier: scholars,"Taipei, May 22 (CNA) Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克強) made scant mention of Taiwan in an important annual speech Friday, reflecting China's focus on its economy as it juggles a trade war with the United States and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, according to scholars of cross-strait relations.On Friday morning, Li delivered the government's work report -- a speech often compared to the U.S. state of the union address -- at the opening of China's annual parliamentary meeting, the National People's Congress.The 14,000 word speech was shorter than in previous years, which have averaged around 20,000 words, and also notable in that its references to Taiwan were limited to about 100 words.Tung Li-wen (董立文), an advisory board member at Taiwan Thinktank, told CNA Friday that the relatively minor references to Taiwan in the speech show that China currently has its hands full managing the economic impact of its trade war with the U.S. and the COVID-19 pandemic.As relates to Taiwan, Tung noted that last week China unveiled 11 incentives targeting Taiwanese businesses operating in China, showing that the country needs to retain Taiwanese talent and technology amid the tough economic climate.Chang Yu-shao (張宇韶), deputy secretary of the Cross-Strait Policy Association, characterized the language on Taiwan in the speech as ""soft in tone, but not without its jagged edges.""Li did not invoke political concepts such as ""one country, two systems"" or the ""1992 consensus"" in reference to Taiwan, and instead relied on broader appeals to Chinese nationhood, Chang said.At the same time, the speech omitted the word ""peaceful"" in its reference to ""national reunification,"" he said.The speech's more hardline content came in the announcement of new national security legislation for Hong Kong, though this also contained a sort of implicit threat to Taiwan, Chang said.Meanwhile, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded to Li's speech Friday with language from President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) recent inaugural address.In a statement, the MAC rejected China's ""one country, two systems"" model for ""downgrading Taiwan and undermining the cross-strait status quo.""Instead, it urged Beijing to accept Tsai's principles of ""peace, parity, democracy and dialogue"" as the foundation for cross-strait interaction.(By Lai Yen-hsi and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005220019

The 3nm process is expected to begin commercial production in 2022.Through its partnership with Broadcom, TSMC's next generation CoWoS packaging services provide bandwidth of up to 2.7 terabytes per second, which is 2.7 times faster than the CoWoS solution the chipmaker previously offered in 2016.TSMC said with higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the CoWoS solution jointly developed with Broadcom is well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as deep learning, workloads for 5G networking and power-efficient data centers.At an investor conference held in mid-January, TSMC said the company expects to benefit from solid demand for smartphones, high performance computer (HPC) devices, Internet of Things related applications and automotive electronics this year.Amid optimism over global demand, TSMC has devoted itself to high-end technology development, a move expected to boost its global competitive edge and sustain the company's lead over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., which has started advanced technology processes with an eye to gaining a larger share of the global market.For the development of its high-end processes, TSMC has said capital expenditure for 2020 is expected to range from US$15-16 billion, the highest level in the company's history.Currently, TSMC has more than 50 percent of the global pure wafer foundry market.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003040004

3/6/2020,Taiwan shares plunge on U.S. market volatility,"Taipei, March 6 (CNA) Taiwan shares moved sharply lower Friday morning after the U.S. markets plunged overnight on growing fears over the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States, dealers said.Investors scrambled to dump large cap stocks across the board, with the downturn led by tech heavyweights, such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, they said.As of 10:58 a.m., the benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) or the Taiex, had fallen 169.29 points, or 1.47 percent, to 11,345.53 on turnover of NT$85.07 billion (US$2.84 billion).""The market was battered by panic selling soon after it opened, as investors saw an almost 1,000 point dive on the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight,"" Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su said. The Dow plunged 3.58 percent Thursday.""Market sentiment here was moved by a soaring VIX on the U.S. markets as investors at home and abroad feared the COVID-19 spread in the U.S., the largest economy in the world, will further affect the global economy.""The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX), which is widely considered an ideal gauge of fear in the market, soared about 14 percent overnight.The spread of the COVID-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has undermined production in China and interrupted global supply chains. The contagion could also hurt private consumption in the U.S.Since the novel coronavirus first emerged at the end of December, more than 96,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with infections in more than 80 countries and territories and more than 3,300 deaths, the majority of which have been in China.""Such unfavorable circumstances are expected to pose threats to Taiwan's export-oriented economy,"" Su said.It was no surprise that Friday's selling in Taiwan focused on the bellwether electronics sector, which depends heavily on global demand, Su said.As of 10:58 a.m., TSMC had lost 2.01 percent to NT$316.50 with 25.07 million shares changing hands after its American depositary receipts (ADRs) lost 2.37 percent on U.S. markets overnight.Led by TSMC, the electronics sector was down 1.43 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index was down 1.76 percent.Also in the high tech sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had lost 1.93 percent to NT$81.10, while Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., was little changed at NT$4,600.00.Following a 1.45 percent fall in its ADRs overnight, integrated circuit packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. had lost 2.99 percent to NT$71.40, while IC designer MediaTek Inc. had lost 1.17 percent to NT$380.50.Selling was also seen among large cap old economy stocks with Formosa Plastics Corp. down 1.61 percent at NT$91.80 and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 2.15 percent at NT$68.20.In the financial sector, Fubon Financial Holding Co. had fallen 1.88 percent to NT$44.30, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. had lost 1.37 percent to NT$39.60.""The silver lining was that the magnitude of the fall in the local market was not as heavy as elsewhere in the world as the TWSE remained awash in liquidity and many investors appeared willing to park their money here,"" Su said.""I expect the Taiex will see strong support at around the 240-day moving average of 11,049 points,"" Su said.

3/13/2020,Stabilization fund ready to shore up equity market: MOF,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Finance Minister Su Jain-rong (蘇建榮) on Friday said the National Financial Stabilization Fund is ready to lend support to the local equity market and its committee could meet at anytime if necessary, amid global volatility spurred by escalating fears over the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 worldwide.At a news conference held at around 8:15 a.m., 45 minutes before the local equity market opened, Su urged investors to remain confident in Taiwan's economic fundamentals, saying the Ministry of Finance, the central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission will come up with measures to stabilize the stock market.Su made the comments as concerns over the spread of COVID-19 intensfied, sending ripples through global financial markets.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,352 points or almost 10 percent, the largest single session drop since Oct. 19, 1987, when the index shed 22.6 percent amid a global financial crisis, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index also dropped more than 9 percent even though the U.S. Federal Reserve took the unusual step of injecting funds into the market.Despite Su's remarks, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taiex still opened down 331.29 points at 10,091.03 and the weakness continued on panic-led selling across the board.Su said the stabilization fund is watching the local equity market closely and its committee could meet anytime, if necessary, and jump into the market to counter the impact of global volatility.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.The fund intervenes in the market when it receives authorization from the fund committee, which is currently managed by Vice Finance Minister Juan Ching-hwa (阮清華), who is executive secretary of the fund.However, Su said with the virus, originally from the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading worldwide, it is no surprise that the global economy faces severe challenges with plunging equity markets around the world.In addition to the dive on the U.S. markets, the equity markets in France, Germany and the United Kingdom also tumbled 12.28 percent, 12.24 percent and 10.87 percent, respectively, Thursday.Compared with the markets in the U.S. and Europe, Juan said, Taiwanese equities appear resilient despite the ongoing scare over the virus. He cited data from Feb. 24 to March 12, showing that the Taiex fell 10.82 percent, while the Dow dropped 26.88 percent, and the markets in France, Germany and the U.K. shed 32.93 percent, 32.54 percent and 29.26 percent, respectively.The relatively small drop in Taiwan came as the country has executed efficient and effective measures to contain the spread of the virus, Juan said, adding that healthy economic fundamentals and attractive dividend yields in the equity market have enabled Taiwanese stocks to fend off unfavorable external factors to some extent.""It is unnecessary for investors to panic,"" Juan said, ""They should have faith in the local equity market.""(By Wu Chia-jung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003130003

3/28/2020,U.S. reportedly eyes curb of TSMC's supply to Huawei,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) The United States has been aiming to curb the supply of chips sold by contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to China's Huawei Technologies Co. through planned heavier sanctions against the Chinese telecom equipment giant, according to a Reuters report.The report said while tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating with both sides blaming each other for spreading the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Trump administration has a plan to introduce new measures to further restrict global chip sales to Huawei.Under the proposed new rules, the report, dated Thursday in Washington, said foreign companies that use U.S. production equipment to roll out their chips would be required to obtain a U.S. license ahead of sales of certain chips to Huawei, which was blacklisted last year.Citing unnamed sources, the report said the measures are aimed at curbing supplies of chips to Huawei's integrated circuit design subsidiary arm HiSilicon Technologies Co. from TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.The report said it remained unknown whether President Donald Trump will approve the new sanction measures since he appeared to oppose the measures in February. If the new measures are imposed, Huawei and TSMC, as well as American enterprises, will feel the pinch, it said.The report quoted a research paper written by China-based Everbright Securities last year as saying most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials.""This is going to have a far more negative impact on U.S. companies than it will on Huawei, because Huawei will develop their own supply chain,"" trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said in the report. ""Ultimately, Huawei will find alternatives.""In Taipei, TSMC said it was unable to respond to any ""hypothetical questions"" and would not comment on any individual clients.According to a market estimate, Huawei accounts for about 10 percent of TSMC's total sales. Market analysts said if the strict rules are imposed, TSMC will see its shipments squeezed.After the possible heavier sanctions against Huawei surfaced, shares of TSMC gave up earlier gains of 2.14 percent on the Friday trading session in Taipei, falling 2.50 percent to close at NT$273.00 (US$9.03) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index also came off an earlier high of 9,954.86 points, down 0.38 percent to end at 9,698.92.On Friday, foreign institutional investors sold a net 5.23 million TSMC shares, stopping a three-day streak of a net buy, but for the entire week, such investors recorded a net buy of 28.47 million TSMC shares.TSMC's American depositary receipts on the U.S. market also fell 5.94 percent overnight as the market came under pressure amid fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.(By Emmanuelle Tseng, Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003280003

3/31/2020,Taiwan urges WHO to review restrictions on its participation,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to review what it described as the WHO's ""unfair restrictions"" on Taiwan at a time when the world is struggling with the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).The ministry was responding to a rare WHO statement dated March 29 that directly mentioned the issue of Taiwan's desire to participate in the organization and cited instances in which it has not left Taiwan alone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.""The question of Taiwanese membership in WHO is up to WHO Member States, not WHO staff,"" The WHO statement said.""However, WHO is working closely with all health authorities who are facing the current coronavirus pandemic, including Taiwanese health experts,"" the statement said.MOFA said in a statement Monday night that while Taiwan and the WHO have established contact points under the International Health Regulations (IHR), Taiwan in most cases provides information unilaterally that is not shared by the WHO to other countries.The ministry lamented that Taiwan cannot participate in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), a network established by the WHO to respond rapidly to outbreaks of international importance, and has no access to timely information through that system.According to MOFA, Taiwan has applied to attend 187 WHO technical meetings from 2009 to 2019, but received approval only 57 of the time, representing a rejection rate of 70 percent.""This indicates that when handling Taiwan's participation in its technical meetings, WHO continues to restrict Taiwan for political reasons,"" MOFA said.""Taiwan calls on the WHO Secretariat to continue to reevaluate the unfair restrictions it has imposed on Taiwan based on political considerations,"" the ministry urged, citing support for Taiwan's participation in the international community.Taiwan, under its formal name, the Republic of China, was a founding member of the WHO. However, it was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.It has not been a member of the United Nations or the WHO since then.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310005
3/31/2020,Hon Hai shares edge higher on 2019 results,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker that churns out many of Apple's iPhones, moved higher Tuesday morning after it reported an increase in earnings per share (EPS) for 2019, dealers said.The gains were limited, however, as investors were wary of a fall in Hon Hai's profit margins amid escalating competition in the global market and concerns over a possible delay in the launch of the next generation iPhones amid the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.As of 11:38 a.m., shares of Hon Hai had gained 0.29 percent to NT$70.20 (US$2.32), off a high of NT$70.50, on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index was up 1.13 percent at 9,738.67 following gains in the U.S. overnight.In a statement released Monday, Hon Hai said it posted net profit of NT$115.31 billion in 2019, down 10.65 percent from a year earlier, but its EPS of NT$8.32 beat its EPS of NT$8.03 in 2018.Analysts said the EPS growth largely resulted from Hon Hai's move to cut its capitalization by about 20 percent in 2018 to NT$138.63 billion to maintain its EPS above the NT$8 level.It was the first time the company had lowered its capital since it first listed publicly in June 1991.Though EPS rose in 2019, the company's lower gross margin and operating profit margin fell due to intensifying global competition, giving investors pause.The company had a gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- of 5.91 percent in 2019, down 0.36 percentage points from a year earlier, and its net margin -- the difference between its gross profit and its total expenses -- was down 0.29 percentage points to 2.15 percent in 2019.Its operating profit margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- was also down 0.42 percentage points to 2.15 percent.In addition to cutting its paid-in capital, Hon Hai was also able to maintain its EPS above NT$8 in 2019 because of efforts to automate its production, a fall in the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, and a sharp decline in the losses of subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd.The Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, in which Hon Hai holds a 62.8 percent stake, cut its net loss to US$12.29 million in 2019 from US$857.12 million a year earlier because of efforts to keep costs down.Hon Hai had consolidated sales of NT$5.34 trillion in 2019, the highest in the company's history, but they were only up 0.92 percent from a year earlier.Hon Hai said it has scheduled an annual general meeting for June 23.Analysts have estimated that Hon Hai's sales in the first quarter of 2020 will fall 40 percent from NT$1.74 trillion in the fourth quarter to below NT$1 trillion because of slow season effects and falling demand caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.(By Chung Jung-feng and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310006

The latter was previously identified as the 122nd COVID-19 case in the country.The 307th case, the CECC said, sought medical attention several times between March 25 and March 28 when he started developing chest distress, muscle pain and fever.The other locally-infected patient, identified as case No. 322, involved a 20-year old college student who developed a cough, nausea and a fever on March 26, and subsequently sought medical help on March 29.Prior to his symptoms, the student spent most of his time on campus in the dormitory, the CECC said, noting that it has so far identified 13 people who came into contact with him.The center said it is still trying to establish how the student was infected.Among the 14 new imported cases reported on Tuesday, the countries visited included the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, the Philippines, Iceland, France and Switzerland.Meanwhile, case No. 315 is a female student who recently returned from the U.K. and is a classmate of cases 257, 258 and 300, the CECC said.(By Ko Lin) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310008

3/31/2020,Migrant factory employees call for dorms to be moved offsite,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A coalition of migrant rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations staged a rally in Taipei on Tuesday, calling for factory dormitories to be relocated away from the work site in the interest of safety.The approximately 50 people, gathered outside the Ministry of Labor (MOL), cited three incidents in recent years, in which 11 migrant workers and six firefighters died in blazes that broke out at factories that had dorms on the premises.In the most recent incident, three Vietnamese workers, who were housed in a dorm on the second floor of a metal manufacturing plant in Taichung, died when the factory went up in flames on March 22.""The root of the problem is that when those factories caught fire, it also burned down the dormitories because they were part of the factory,"" said Hsu Wei-tung (許惟棟) of the migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT). ""So, we are here today calling for the MOL to mandate that dormitories be located away from the workplace to save the lives of migrant workers and firefighters.""Prior to the Taoyuan fire earlier this month, six Vietnamese migrant workers in Taoyuan City died in December 2017 in a factory fire that engulfed their dormitory, which was on the upper level of a factory warehouse made of sheet iron. The structure belonged to Sican Co., which runs a factory that produces solar control window film.Four months later, a blaze at a facility operated by Chin Poon, a printed circuit board factory in Taoyuan, claimed the lives of two Thai workers who were trapped in a dormitory on the factory premises, while six firefighters died in the rescue efforts.""The firefighters rushed into the burning factory because it was their duty to save lives,"" Chu Chih-yu (朱智宇), secretary general of the National Association for Firefighters' Rights, said at Tuesday's rally. ""But if people didn't live inside the factory, then the firefighters would not have had to put their lives on the line and enter the burning building.""The migrant workers at the rally, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, along with Taiwanese supporters, shouted slogans and burned incense at a makeshift altar in memory of those who had perished in the factory fires.A Filipino, who asked to be identified only as Arturo, said when he was working at a factory in Taoyuan last year, he was housed in a dorm in the basement of the building with nine coworkers.""There was once an earthquake and we felt extremely scared because there was only one exit from the basement. Imagine a fire -- we all would have been trapped,"" said Arturo, whose right hand was severed in a factory accident last year.Another Philippine worker said, however, that work safety is not the sole responsibility of the employer, and there is no guarantee that factory employees will be safe even if their dorms are offsite.""I have seen workers cooking in their rooms when they are not supposed to, plugging as many as 10 power adaptors to one outlet in the wall, and bringing cellphones into the work area,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named.Common sense is what is most important when it comes to safety, she said, adding that she works with toxic, flammable and combustible materials on a daily basis.In response to the protesters' calls, Huang Wei-cheng (黃偉誠), a section chief at the MOL's Workforce Development Agency, said the ministry is planning to amend the law to make it mandatory for factories that have onsite dorms to file safety reports, which would include a declaration of any pyrophoric substances or flammable gases on the site.The legislation, which is expected to be completed by June, will also state how often safety checks will be carried out at factories, according to a statement issued later by the MOL.Hsu, however, expressed skepticism about such safety checks, saying that there are some 100,000 dormitories throughout Taiwan for migrant workers, while the number of inspectors responsible for checking on the welfare of the workers totals only 274.""Work safety and the general welfare checks are usually carried out once, when a migrant worker first arrives in Taiwan, due to a lack of manpower,"" Hsu said.Among the 719,847 migrant workers in Taiwan, 455,934 are employed in the industrial sector, according to MOL statistics valid as of the end of February.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310011

3/31/2020,Transgender activists release 7 policy demands,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Activists marked Tuesday's International Transgender Day of Visibility by announcing seven policy demands based on what they called the largest-ever survey of Taiwan's transgender community.At a press conference, the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) announced the results of the survey, which was open to respondents who identify as transgender under the broad definition of the term -- those whose gender identities or expressions differ from what is typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.The survey, which was conducted online March 14-25, received 518 valid responses, which served as the basis for the seven policy proposals, the TAPCPR said.The alliance's first two demands were to end the practice of requiring sex reassignment surgery for people seeking to change the gender designation on their national identification cards, as well as allowing coverage of elective sex reassignment surgeries under Taiwan's National Health Insurance program.According to a 2013 report on Taiwan's implementation of human rights by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the former requirement could constitute a form of torture, the group said.These concerns were further borne out in survey results, the TAPCPR said, in which 30.42 percent of the respondents said they were unsure about the safety of such surgeries, 29.54 percent doubted their necessity and 52.3 percent considered them prohibitively expensive.In its third and fourth demands, meanwhile, the group called for acceptance of the transgender community's collective diversity and for reforms of Taiwan's gender designation policies based on consultations with the transgender community.As an example of this diversity, the group cited survey results showing that 52 percent of the respondents identified as either male or female, while 48 percent identified themselves as nonbinary, gender-fluid or agender.Given the complexity of gender identity revealed in the survey results, the government should abandon the poorly received ""third gender policy"" it proposed in 2017, and instead should adopt new guidelines based on consultations with the transgender community, the alliance said.Fifth, the alliance called for an abolition of legal distinctions between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages.Because Taiwan's marriage equality law was passed as a special act rather than a revision of the Civil Code, which governs opposite-sex marriage, the legal rights enjoyed by the two forms of marriage vary, with a disproportionate impact on transgender individuals, the group said.For example, if a person married under the Civil Code seeks to change their gender designation and have their marriage recognized under the marriage equality act, they lose the right to adopt children as a couple and can only adopt their partner's biological children as a step-parent, the group said.On a broader social level, the alliance recommended starting gender identity education beginning in elementary school as a way of pre-empting the experience of the 47.68 percent of survey respondents who said they were bullied, discriminated against or otherwise mistreated at school.Similarly, the government should include transgender people in its monitoring of hate crimes, given that 37.3 percent of those surveyed said they had suffered workplace discrimination, the alliance said.Overall, the survey respondents reported suffering a wide range of social difficulties related to their gender identification.These included 55.41 percent who feared discrimination in public restrooms, 24.32 percent who delayed or avoided medical treatment and 22.01 percent who had been discriminated against while shopping for clothes or accessories.Another 18.53 percent said they had been sexually harassed or attacked in public, while 15.83 percent were afraid to call the police in an emergency, according to the survey results.(By Yang Su-min and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310015
3/31/2020,Constitutional Court hears debate on decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Grand justices heard arguments at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday on whether a criminal law that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after several judges asked for an interpretation of the law.Article 239 of Taiwan's Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.Eighteen judges and a male who was convicted of adultery have asked the Constitutional Court in recent years to overturn Interpretation 554, which determined that Article 239 was constitutional.The most recent one was a judge surnamed Chen (陳) from the Miaoli District Court who mainly hears cases related to ""offenses against marriage,"" who felt Article 239 may violate the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan).The court finally agreed to hear the case and heard arguments Tuesday, some of which centered around Interpretation 554.The interpretation, which was made in 2002, ruled that the freedom of sexual behavior is inseparably related to the personality of individuals, and every person is free to decide whether or not and with whom to have sexual affairs.Such freedom is, however, legally protected only if it is not detrimental to the social order or public interest as provided in Article 22 of the Constitution, and therefore the freedom of sexual behavior is subject to the restriction put on it by marriage and the family system, the ruling said.One of the judges arguing for decriminalization, Wu Chih-chiang (吳志強), said adultery is not the only factor that shakes a marriage and therefore there was no need to intervene with ""national punishment.""He argued that Article 239 could lead to unfairness and inequality in administering punishment, forcing people to maintain an unwanted marriage.Wu was referring to complaints by supporters of the decriminalization of adultery that under Article 239 the crime of adultery cannot be prosecuted without a complaint by the victim, and if one spouse withdraws charges against the other, the withdrawal does not apply to the outside party.That has led in practice to women likely to be pressured by their husbands to drop the charges against them during the proceedings, yet the cases against the mistresses go ahead.Judge Chang Yuan-sen (張淵森) argued that the purpose of criminalizing adultery was to protect the family and social morals and prevent people from suffering in a miserable marriage.Yet while the law gives people the ability to get married and divorced freely, it cannot use criminal law to ""threaten"" people into acting faithfully in a marriage, he contended.Many factors cause suffering in a marriage, including the relationship between the wife and her mother-in-law, child education problems, financial issues, and sexual relations, Chang said.""If one person suffers in a marriage, it does not mean the other party has to be punished. Suffering should not be a reason for punishment in the Criminal Code,"" he said.Chi Hui-jung (紀惠容), a former executive director of the Garden of Hope Foundation who attended the Constitutional Court as a friend of the court to present her opinions, called Article 239 a law that punishes women.Although there are more men charged for adultery than women, in the end more women, most of them the mistresses in the cases, are convicted, she said.At the same time, she argued, the crime of adultery uses the Criminal Code to deter people from having affairs, but in a society that now frowns on using corporal punishment to discipline children, it is inappropriate to use ""threats"" to keep marriages together.Deputy Minister of Justice Tsai Pi-chung (蔡碧仲) argued, however, that the criminalization of adultery is aimed at safeguarding the marriage and family system.To support her position, Tsai cited Interpretation No. 544, which says the root of the nation's marital system lies in the freedom of personality, with such social functions as the maintenance of the order of human relationships and gender equality, and the raising of children.To insure an enduring and unimpaired system of marriage, the state may of course enact relevant rules to require a husband and wife to be mutually bound to each other by the duty of faithfulness, the interpretation says.The freedoms of individuals should still be restricted by the need to maintain social order, Tsai argued, and therefore Article 239 is not unconstitutional.(By Lin Chang-shun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310016
3/31/2020,Prosecutors voice support for decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310017
3/31/2020,Taiwan further expands screening to curb COVID-19 pandemic,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Tuesday announced that it will expand the scope of COVID-19 coronavirus screening tests to all patients with pneumonia and those who have lost their sense of smell or taste, effective immediately.Henceforth, patients with such symptoms will be required to undergo coronavirus screening tests, said CECC expert Chang Shan-chwen (張上淳) during a news briefing.Chang said the CECC decided to expand screening to patients with pneumonia in the hope that doing so will make it easier to detect those infected with COVID-19 more quickly and before they infect others.The decision came after two of the most recent cases were individuals with no recent overseas travel history, who tested positive for coronavirus only after doctors sent their samples for screening following a pneumonia diagnosis, according to the CECC.As of Monday, 24 of the more than 300 confirmed cases in Taiwan were found to have lost their sense of smell or taste, prompting the CECC to subject those with such symptoms to screening, he added.Previously, Taiwan only conducted COVID-19 tests on those with respiratory symptoms and fever who had recently traveled to countries with coronavirus outbreaks, or who had contact with coronavirus patients.The CECC last week further expanded the scope of screening to medical and healthcare workers with suspected infection symptoms in order to prevent possible cluster infections in the nation's healthcare system.Taiwan recorded 16 new infections on Tuesday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 322 with five deaths since the coronavirus emerged in China at the end of last year, according to CECC statistics.As of Tuesday, the CEEC had conducted 31,800 tests since the epidemic started in late December.(By Chen Wei-ting, Yu Hsiao-han and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310018

3/31/2020,Taiwan's surgical mask output hits 13 million per day,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's daily surgical mask output has hit 13 million, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Tuesday.The current daily output is more than four times the amount that Taiwan was capable of producing in early February, when Taiwan produced an average of 3.2 million surgical masks per day.That amount, however, is far from enough to meet the demand for surgical masks, which are widely used in Taiwan to prevent against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.In response to the high demand, the government banned the export of all surgical masks in late January, requisitioned all domestically produced masks, and instituted a rationing system to limit the number of masks people could buy per week.It also purchased 92 mask production lines, which have been set up in 40 days and have largely contributed to the significant surge in output.With the increase in output, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced Monday that people would be able to buy more masks under the rationing system in April.From April 9, residents will have access to nine masks for adults every 14 days, up from three per week at present, while the quota for children's masks will remain at 10 every two weeks, the CECC said.The MOEA is also discussing whether to purchase production lines that can produce N95 masks, which are able to filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles and are mainly used by medical workers on the frontlines.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310020

""MOFA will continue to work with the U.S. and other like-minded countries to advance our shared values and common goals and deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership on the global stage.""The TAIPEI Act was first introduced in the U.S. Senate by Cory Gardner last May, with Republican Congressman John Curtis unveiling a similar version in the House of Representatives in October, amid Beijing's continued efforts to squeeze Taiwan's international space.The legislation was passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier this month and later signed into law by Trump.The Act calls on the U.S. government to further Taiwan-U.S. bilateral trade and economic relations, help Taiwan participate in international organizations, and strengthen Taiwan's partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific region and in the world, according to Ou.It also authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider altering its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious actions to undermine Taiwan's security and prosperity, she said.The Republic of China (Taiwan), a founding member of the WHO, was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.International support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.Taiwan has been trying to rejoin the WHO since 1997. From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was able to participate in the WHA as an observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" with Beijing's approval, as cross-Taiwan Strait relations were warmer at the time.Since 2017, however, the year after President Tai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) took office, the Chinese government has been blocking Taiwan's efforts to participate in the WHA, due to differences between Taipei and Beijing over the so called ""1992 Consensus.""The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China,"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310022
3/31/2020,U.S. military aircraft fly near Taiwan for 4th time this month,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A United States military aircraft was reported flying near Taiwan's southern airspace Tuesday, marking the fourth time this month a U.S. warplane had been spotted operating near the country.The U.S. Navy P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft was operating in the South China Sea, according to a flight chart posted on Twitter on Tuesday by Aircraft Spots, a military air movement tracker.Asked to comment, Taiwanese military spokesman Shih Shun-wen (史順文) did not directly confirm the movement, saying only that the nation's armed forces are closely monitoring the country's surrounding waters and airspace.Based on charts released by Aircraft Spots and Taiwan's own records, the latest incident was the fourth time in March that a U.S. warplane was found to have been operating near the nation's airspace.The previously three occurrences all happened last week: on March 25 by an EP-3E ARIES II reconnaissance aircraft, on March 26 by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber and a KC-135 tanker, and on March 27 by another B-52 bomber and an RC-135U reconnaissance aircraft.Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS McCampbell conducted operations in the Taiwan Strait on March 25, according to information released by the U.S. Pacific Fleet on its Facebook page.The U.S. military's frequent operations around Taiwan, both in the air and at sea in the past week are designed to show that the U.S. is continuing its monitoring of the region, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, local military analysts told CNA.Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), a section chief of the government-funded thinktank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), said the U.S. warplanes intentionally turned on their transponders so that their signals could be picked up by air movement trackers.In this way, it was sending a clear message tactically that it is closely watching the region despite the pandemic.These military movements might also be monitoring any moves made by their Chinese counterparts, he added.Lin Ying-yu (林穎佑), an assistant professor at National Chung Cheng University's Institute of Strategic and International Affairs, said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is apparently playing the ""anti-China/pro-Taiwan"" card by frequently sending warplanes and warships near Taiwan in the hope of gaining more voter support in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310023

Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003310025

5/7/2020,U.S. secretary of state urges WHO chief to invite Taiwan to WHA,"Washington, May 6 (CNA) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday called on the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA), saying it is within a WHO director-general's power to do so.In a press briefing, Pompeo reiterated Washington's support for Taipei's participation as an observer in this year's WHA, the decision-making body of the WHO, which will be held online from May 18-19 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.""Today I want to call upon all nations, including those in Europe, to support Taiwan's participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly and in other relevant United Nations venues,"" he said.He also urged WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to invite Taiwan to the WHA, ""as he has the power to do, and as his predecessors have done on multiple occasions.""Pompeo was referring to the fact that Tedros' predecessor, Margaret Chan (陳馮富珍), had sent invitations to Taiwan to observe the WHA from 2009 to 2016.Asked to comment if he will consider sending an invitation to Taiwan during a WHO press event held in Geneva that day, Tedros did not answer the question, referring it instead to WHO Legal Counsel Derek Walton.Walton reiterated the WHO's stance that the WHO secretariat has no authority to make such a decision unilaterally as it is to be made by all 194 member states.""The involvement, if any, of observers from 'Taiwan, China' in that assembly is a question for the 194 member governments, it's their decision,"" he noted.He also said that a number of member states have already raised proposals to discuss the matter at this year's WHA.He continued that whether or not Taiwan is invited to the assembly this year, there are ""well-established arrangements"" for health experts from ""Taiwan, China"" to work with the WHO on technical health matters.Taiwan participated in the WHA meetings from 2009 to 2016 as on observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei"" amid warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations under the then-Kuomintang (KMT) administration, which prioritized reducing cross-strait tension and building friendly ties with Beijing.Since 2017, however, China has persuaded the WHO not to invite Taiwan, in line with its hardline stance on cross-strait ties after President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office in May 2016.Explaining its decision for not sending invitations to Taiwan since 2017, the WHO said in 2019 that ""previous invitations to the WHA have been issued on the basis of a 'cross-strait understanding,'"" and that the ""absence of such an understanding"" in recent years has resulted in the fact that no more such invitations have been issued.According to the WHO Constitution, although the specialized agency under the U.N. does not recognize observer status, the rules of WHA procedure give the WHO director-general the right to invite observers to the annual WHA meeting, provided that they are ""States that have made application for membership, territories on whose behalf application for associate membership has been made, and States which have signed but not accepted the Constitution.""In response to Pompeo's remarks, Taiwan's foreign ministry on Thursday expressed gratitude, saying that it will continue to work closely with the U.S. and other like-minded countries in sharing Taiwan's success in containing the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The ministry also issued a protest over Walton's remarks that called the nation ""Taiwan, China,"" saying the designation belittled the nation's sovereignty.  (By Stacy Hsu, Tang Pei-chun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005070004

5/17/2020,Doyen of Taiwan's nativist literature movement passes away at 96,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) A doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement"" Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政) passed away at his home in Taoyuan City Saturday, according to his family. He was 96.Chung's son Chung Yen-wei (鍾延威) told reporters that the family found Chung not breathing around 7 p.m. Saturday.Chung Yen-wei said despite his father's old age, he was in relative stable health over the years. The family is deeply saddened and shocked by Chung's sudden passing and is now preparing his funeral.Born in Taoyuan's Longtan district in 1925 during Japanese rule, Chung was widely considered the doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement,"" who was most famous for his works, ""The Dull Ice Flower (魯冰花),"" ""the Turbid Waters Trilogy"" (濁流三部曲) and ""the Taiwanese Trilogy"" (台灣人三部曲).His classics of Taiwanese literature depicts the lives and fates of Taiwanese against the background of post-World War II Taiwan, following the end of the Japanese colonial period.In mourning the passing of Chung, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) expressed condolence to his family and said the passing of the nonagenarian literati is a great loss to the nation's literary circle.In a Facebook post, Tsai also praised Chung, an ethnic Hakka, for playing an import role in promoting Hakka culture and Taiwanese literature.Chung and other writers of his time had jointly published a regular newsletter in the post WWII era, the Literary Bulletin -- a periodical that proved essential to young and aspiring writers of that time, according to Tsai.Tsai said she will always remember Chung as an elder who saw her as his own child. She pledged to bear Chung's teaching in mind to continue the promotion of Hakka and Taiwanese culture so that Chung's legacy will last for generations to come.Asked to comment on Chung's legacy, writer Chen Fang-ming (陳芳明) told CNA that Chung had a tremendous impact toward the development of Taiwanese literature.Chung had played an crucial rule during the transitional period in the 1950s after the Kuomintang (KMT) had just taken over the governing of Taiwan from Japan at the end of Japanese colonial rule, according to Chen.Sincere condolences on the passing of #Hakka literary master Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政). The esteemed writer passed away on May 16 at the age of 96. https://t.co/zUbiiwwuCE pic.twitter.com/PH02BDFO0WAt that time, most Taiwanese could only speak Japanese and very few people could speak Mandarin, let alone write in the Chinese language. Chung was one of a handful of native Taiwanese writers of that time that can.Aside from focusing on his own works, Chung also published the Literary Bulletin that offered a platform for Taiwanese writers to publish their works.Chung's works had faithfully recorded the everyday lives of Taiwanese people of his time which showed his deep connection and affection toward his homeland, Chen noted.The Hakka Affairs Council, meanwhile, remembered Chung as not only a prolific writer but a devoted promoter of Hakka affairs who helped promote the awareness of Hakka culture to a national level, which successfully led to the creation in the 1990s of a dedicated Hakka language radio station.(By Chiu Chun-chin, Su Lung-chi Chen Ping-hung, Wu Hsin-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005170003

The last time Taiwan recorded a domestic infection was on April 12.The lack of cases has led to a gradual loosening of restrictions that have been in place, and Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC, said at a daily briefing that special entertainment establishments could reopen under certain circumstances.The establishments, such as hostess KTVs and hostess dance clubs, would have to adopt social distancing guidelines, and customers and staff members would need to wear masks and have their temperatures checked and use hand sanitizer before entering the premise, Chen said.A system will also have to be in place that allows the businesses to reach customers after they have left, Chen said.""If the local governments can ensure these measures, then we can start re-opening these establishments,"" Chen said.Since the outbreak of COVID-19 late last year, Taiwan has recorded 440 cases, 349 of which have been classified as imported and 55 as local infections, according to CECC statistics.The other 36 cases are a cluster infection on a Navy vessel that returned April 9 from a Pacific goodwill mission. Those cases have not yet been classified as either local or imported, CECC data showed.To date, 395 COVID-19 patients in Taiwan have recovered, seven have died, with the remainder are still hospitalized, the CECC said in a statement.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 4,660,752 people in 187 countries and regions, including 1,489,642 in the United States, 272,043 in Russia, 240,161 in the United Kingdom, 230,698 in Spain and 224,760 in Italy, with a total of 311,064 fatalities, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.(By William Yen) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005170005

5/17/2020,Taiwan advised to work with major economies after COVID-19,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan must seize the opportunity to work with major economies seeking to relocate global supply chains outside of China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic scholars suggested as President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) begins her second term on May 20.The pandemic, which has made many countries aware of their growing economic dependence on China for goods in several critical sectors, has led to calls to delink global supply chains of major industries from China.That trend offers an extremely good opportunity to Taiwan, said Ray Yang (楊瑞臨), consulting director of the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center (ISTI) under the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).He said the United States, China and Europe may all look to develop independent production capabilities in the post-COVID-19 world, and Taiwan has an opportunity to become an important partner for all of them.Yang said the U.S. will still be the world leader but cannot go it alone and will itself have to form partnerships with economies such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Taiwan is well positioned, Yang said, because the COVID-19 crisis has opened the world's eyes to the strengths of Taiwanese businesses, including their ability to respond quickly to different situations, high degree of flexibility and quality of manufactured goods.That was seen most clearly in Taiwan's ramping up of production of face masks and protective gear for medical workers to meet high demand during the coronavirus epidemic, he said.Meanwhile, Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, predicted that the U.S. economy would recover faster from the coronavirus pandemic than China.That trend has already prompted more Taiwanese businesses operating overseas to increase investment in Taiwan and reduce investment in China and other countries, Chiu said.Chiu also contended it will be in Taiwan's interests if the United States create an alliance of ""trusted partners"" to restructure supply chains away from China, as has been reported.According to a Reuters report in early May, the alliance would apply common standards for everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to trade, education and commerce, with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, India and Vietnam among potential partners.Though Taiwan is not on the list of ""trusted partners,"" it is a reasonable assumption that Taiwan has an opportunity to be included in the next phase given that Taiwan is considered a partner in the U.S.'s ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,"" Chiu said.""We must let the United States know that Taiwan can make its planned supply chains more complete,"" Chiu said, pointing to Taiwan's semiconductor industry's advantage in wafer fabrication and packaging and testing technology, which would help build the U.S.'s IC design capabilities.Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises' strength in producing spare parts and component production could also strengthen those new supply chains, Chiu said.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wu Po-wei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005170008

So that's a great event,"" said Fotland, fondly called ""Norwegian grandpa"" by many Taiwanese who know him.Oslo is usually not keen on promoting Taiwan due to Beijing's influence in recent years, but major newspapers in Norway started to mention Taiwan in May because of its good performance in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, he said.""Taiwan has shown the world that we are independent from COVID-19 while the rest of the world is occupied by COVID-19, as Norway.""Oslo cut its official ties with Taipei in January 1950. Neither government has a liaison office on the other's soil after Oslo closed its trade office in Taipei in 2004 and Taipei closed its representative office in Norway in 2017.According to Fotland, there are about 10 Norwegian students and six to eight Norwegian nationals living in Taiwan, some of them retired and others here doing business.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005170009
5/17/2020,Presidential Secretary-General Chen Chu to step down May 20,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Presidential Secretary-General Chen Chu (陳菊) said Sunday on Facebook she will leave her post on May 20 when President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) begins her second term.Chen said it was the right time to leave the Presidential Office as Taiwan moves into a new phase and the president needs more freedom to make personnel arrangements.""Therefore I have decided to leave the Presidential Office where I have served for two years,"" she said.Chen will reportedly be nominated by Tsai to serve as the president of the Control Yuan.In the future, the functions of the Control Yuan will be adjusted and its head will also serve as the chief of the Control Yuan's National Human Rights Committee after it is established, according to an amendment passed on Dec. 10, 2019.That date was the 40th anniversary of the Kaohsiung Incident, a government crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. Chen was arrested and jailed for her participation in the protests.(By Wen Kuei-hsiang and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005170010
5/17/2020,Rights group urges Taiwan to allow cross-national same-sex marriage,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) The Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) and several same-sex couples on Sunday urged Taiwan's government to allow same-sex marriages between couples from different countries.Taiwan's government legalized same-sex marriage in May 2019, becoming the first Asian country to do so.According to the Act Governing the Choice of Law in Civil Matters Involving Foreign Elements, however, a cross-national same-sex marriage can only be recognized in Taiwan if the countries of which the two partners are citizens both recognize same-sex marriage.The restriction discriminates against the LGBT community in Taiwan as marriage is a constitutional right, Pan Tien-ching (潘天慶), a lawyer from the TAPCPR, said at a press conference held near Taiwan's Presidential Office Building.Several cross-national same-sex couples lamented their difficult situations at the press conference.""For many cross-national same-sex couples, including me and my wife, our efforts to be with our loved ones are symbolized by our old plane ticket stubs,"" said Kaili Lai, a Taiwanese LGBT married to a Malaysian Tan Bee Guat.According to Lai, she and Tan held a simple wedding in Malaysia in 2016 with the blessings of their parents.Tan was not allowed to live in Taiwan, however because she was not a Taiwanese citizen and could not get a residence certificate because her marriage to Lai was not recognized.They had to fly frequently between Taiwan and Malaysia to see each other, leaving Tan little choice but to enroll in a university in Taiwan as a freshmen at the age of 35 to be able to stay in Taiwan on a student visa.But Tan is graduating next month and will have to enroll in a graduate school program to continue staying in Taiwan.Another cross-national same-sex couple, Joyce from Taiwan and Queenie from the Philippines, are facing the same predicament -- Queenie has to enroll in National Taiwan Normal University for the same purpose.According to the TAPCPR, the signature campaign it launched on May 9 to petition the government to amend laws that restrict same-sex marriage between such couples received 13,500 signatures and support from 20 human rights watchdogs in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Indonesia and the United States.The TAPCPR said it had written to relevant government units such as the Ministry of Justice, Mainland Affairs Council, National Immigration Agencies and the Ministry of Interiors on the issue.""Most government agencies have agreed that the issues need to be addressed but admitted that more coordination between relevant agencies is needed,"" the TAPCPR said as it urged President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to resolve the issue.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005170011

5/20/2020,Full text of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's second-term inaugural address,"Taipei, May 20 (CNA) The following is the full text of President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) inaugural address to start her second term, as released by the Presidential Office Wednesday:Vice President Lai, esteemed guests, friends watching on TV and online, my fellow citizens across the country, good morning.I feel immensely grateful to stand here once again today and take on the responsibility entrusted to me by the Taiwanese people.This inauguration ceremony is unique in the history of the Republic of China. What makes it special is not its size or the number of people in attendance. It is special because we know how difficult it has been for us to get to this point.I want to thank the people of Taiwan for making such a difficult feat possible.I particularly want to thank a group of people who have not received a lot of attention over the past four months in our fight against COVID-19. I want to thank every single person who waited in line outside of the pharmacy in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for trusting the government. You have shown the world Taiwan's commitment to civic virtues, even in times of greatest distress.I also want to thank everyone who was quarantined or isolated at home, putting up with inconvenience in your daily life to keep others safe and healthy. Thank you for exemplifying humanity's best qualities and helping us successfully bring the coronavirus outbreak under control.This sense of pride in our country, this community's shared destiny, and the memories of these past months will live on in all of our hearts. This is what solidarity feels like.Many ambassadors and representatives from other countries are here today, and I trust that many countries around the world are watching Taiwan as well.I want to take this opportunity to tell you that the country you see is populated by kind and resilient people. No matter the difficulties we face, we can always count on our democracy, our solidarity, and our sense of responsibility towards each other to help us overcome challenges, weather difficult times, and stand steadfast in the world.From January to now, Taiwan has amazed the international community twice. The first was our democratic elections, and the second was our success in the fight against COVID-19.In recent months, Taiwan's name has appeared in headlines around the world, thanks to our successful containment of the coronavirus outbreak.""Taiwan"" is also emblazoned on the boxes of supplies we are sending abroad. The Taiwanese people have the kindest hearts in the entire world, and we will always offer help to the international community whenever we are able.I hope that in addition to sharing in a sense of pride and joy, my fellow citizens can take to heart the spirit of ""helping ourselves to help others;"" ""when we help ourselves, others will help us.""This pandemic has not yet ended, and we must remain vigilant. Even when it ends, its impacts will linger on.The coronavirus has profoundly affected our world. It has changed the global political and economic order, accelerated and expanded the reorganization of global supply chains, restructured the global economy, and changed the way we live and shop. It has even changed the way the international community views Taiwan and developments in the surrounding region.These changes present us with both challenges and opportunities. I want to ask that my fellow citizens be prepared, because countless challenges and difficulties remain ahead of us.Over the next four years, only those who can end the pandemic within their borders, lay out a strategy for their country's survival and development, and take advantage of opportunities in the complex world of tomorrow, will be able to set themselves apart on the international stage.It takes more than fervor to govern a country. Leadership means calmly taking the right direction in a changing world. That is precisely what I have done over the past four years.I said before that I will leave you with a better country. So over the next four years, I will proactively develop our industries, foster a safe society, ensure national security, and deepen our democracy. I am going to reinvent Taiwan and lead our country into the future.1. Industrial and Economic DevelopmentI know that the Taiwanese people are most concerned about our industrial and economic development. In 2016, we initiated a new economic development model to help connect Taiwan's economy to the world. Over the past four years, despite massive changes in the international economy, Taiwan has done more than just weather the storm. Our economic growth has once again topped the Four Asian Tigers, and the stock market index now regularly breaks 10,000 points.Thanks to our successful control of the pandemic, so far, Taiwan is able to maintain positive economic growth. This is rare in the world. However, we need to continue to take early action on economic relief and revitalization, and do whatever it takes to maintain stable economic growth.Over the next four years, we will face more intense changes in the global economy and the accelerated reorganization of supply chains. We will continue to implement our Forward-looking Infrastructure Development and trillion NT-dollar investment programs. We will do so in the spirit of ""achieving growth through stability, and seizing opportunity amid changes,"" in order to secure Taiwan's economic development over the coming decades.In terms of industrial development, we are going to take advantage of the opportunities before us in six core strategic industries founded on our 5+2 Innovative Industries Program, to transform Taiwan into a critical force in the global economy.First, we will continue to develop our information and digital industries. We will take advantage of Taiwan's strengths in the semiconductor and ICT industries to secure a central role in global supply chains, and make Taiwan a major base for the development of next generation technologies, including IoT and AI.Second, we are going to develop a cybersecurity industry that can integrate with 5G, digital transformation, and our national security. We will strive to create cybersecurity systems and an industrial chain that can protect our country and earn the world's trust.Third, we are going to create biotech and medical technology industries integrated with the rest of the world. Throughout this pandemic, Taiwanese teams have proven that they are capable of working with world-class technologies to produce reagents and develop new drugs and vaccines. We are going to give these industries our utmost support, and transform Taiwan into a key force in the global battle against infectious diseases.Fourth, we are going to develop national defense and strategic industries by integrating military and civilian capabilities. In addition to domestically-produced naval vessel and aircraft programs that are currently underway, we will push harder to promote technological integration between the military and the private sector, to stimulate private sector production capabilities, and advance into the aviation and space industries.Fifth, we are going to accelerate the development of green energy and renewable energy industries. Over the past four years, renewable energy has experienced explosive growth, and Taiwan has become a hotspot for international investment. Building on this foundation, I am confident that we will achieve our goal of deriving 20% of our overall energy from green sources by 2025. We are going to make Taiwan a center for green energy in Asia.Sixth, we are going to establish strategic stockpile industries that can ensure the steady provision of critical supplies. Facing changes to the global order, we need to keep key industrial chains in Taiwan and maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the production of face masks, medical and daily supplies, energy, and food.In the current international climate, countries that end their dependence on others will have a head start on national development. I would like our friends across all industries to rest assured that our government stands with you. Over the next few years, we have several strategies to drive the growth of our industries.First, we will use domestic demand, particularly demand from the public sector and national security needs, as the basic engine for our industrial development.A prime example of this is the way strategic demand for face masks and other medical supplies throughout this pandemic has spurred the development of related industries. We can adopt a similar model for our national defense and renewable energy industries to help accelerate their development.We will continue to organize ""national teams,"" like our face mask team, according to the size and conditions of different industries. We will utilize our government's guarantee of domestic demand to establish a global strategic materials manufacturing industry under the ""Taiwanese brand"" and help it expand into other markets.We know that financial support is crucial to industrial development. Looking to the future, we will adopt more flexible financial policies, continue to reform financial systems, and use more diverse means to help industries obtain the financing they need.We will also work to create a safe environment for our industries. Our government is committed to maintaining sound public health and national security systems, a stable society, strong rule of law, and a healthy market. We need to offer these guarantees so that high-tech and strategic industries will be willing to choose Taiwan as their production and R&D base.We will also continue to guide the global expansion of our industries. We will keep working to sign trade or investment protection agreements with the United States, Japan, and European countries.As we continue to promote our New Southbound Policy, we will also develop other potential markets and encourage firms to establish operations there, giving our industries an edge when they engage in international cooperation. Overseas Taiwanese business communities around the world will be our best partners as we seek new international opportunities.Finally, we have the issue of talent. In order for Taiwan to become a key global economic force, we need a diverse talent pool. My government will bring in the world's top technical, R&D, and management talents to help globalize Taiwan's workforce, widen our industries' horizons, and give them the ability to compete in the international arena.Looking to the future, Taiwan must further connect with the international community. We will work to cultivate more outstanding bilingual and digital talents, giving our industries a global competitive edge.Over the next four years, Taiwan's economy will enter a new stage, complete with more flexible capital and talent flows, more robust industrial capabilities, and closer ties with the world. Together, we are going to enter a new era of shared prosperity.2. Safe Society: Health and Social Safety Nets to Catch Those Who Need HelpAs we develop our industries, we will also keep in mind that the people expect the government to foster a safe society. To be a better country, the government must take on more responsibilities to reduce the burden on the people and mitigate issues in society.Over the past few years, we have addressed Long-term Care 2.0, childcare, and residential justice issues. Over the next four years, my goal is to weave an even tighter net that can catch every single person who needs help and prevent future tragedies.●Health and Disease Prevention Safety NetFirst, we will strengthen our health and disease prevention safety net. Taiwan is an ageing society, and infectious diseases pose a serious challenge to the health of our people. That is why we need to bolster our disease prevention and treatment capabilities and link industries to make more breakthroughs in vaccine and new drug development, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, so that people can enjoy healthy lives and receive better care.●Mending Gaps in the Social Safety NetOur second step will be to mend the gaps in our social safety net. Over the past few years, a great deal of discussion has arisen around public safety incidents involving schizophrenia patients. The same goes for other mental illnesses, drug addiction, and domestic violence.I understand your concerns. These issues are not just the responsibility of individuals or families, they are the responsibility of the government. When families are unable to provide proper care, the government has a duty to step in and help.I am going to upgrade our social care system, enhance the capabilities of frontline social workers, and improve their work environments, so that they can work at the grassroots and identify people who have fallen through the gaps in our safety net.We cannot hold medical agencies or individual judges solely responsible for controversies surrounding specific cases. Our judicial and executive branches should reevaluate and optimize these systems and take initiatives to make any necessary legal amendments.3. National Security: National Defense Reforms, Active International Participation, Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsA better country requires a greater emphasis on national security. Over the past four years, we have pushed for national defense reforms, active international participation, and peaceful, stable cross-strait relations. We hope that Taiwan can play a more active role in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Over the next four years, the direction of our policies will remain the same, and we will do even more.●National Defense ReformsWe have three important directions for our national defense reforms. First is accelerating the development of our asymmetrical capabilities. While we work to bolster our defense capabilities, future combat capacity development will also emphasize mobility, countermeasures, and non-traditional asymmetrical capabilities. We will also work to strengthen our defenses against the threats of cyber warfare, cognitive warfare, and ""unrestricted"" warfare to achieve our strategic goal of multidomain deterrence.The second is substantive reforms to our military reserve and mobilization systems. We need to enhance the quality of our reserve forces, as well as their weapons, equipment, and training, in order to achieve effective jointness with our regular forces. We also need to establish a standing, interdepartmental system connecting our reserve and mobilization systems. This system will help coordinate personnel and supplies, so that we can successfully mobilize during a transition from peacetime to war.Third is improvements to our military's management institutions. Today's young servicemembers have all grown up in a democratic society, and one of our most important missions will be to find ways for them to better utilize their professional skills in line with military needs.Some young servicemembers have difficulties adjusting to military needs, reflecting the gap between today's society and our military management institutions. We need to work to close that gap. We need to reduce negative societal views of the military and end the gradual erosion of our military's prestige and morale due to individual incidents caused by imperfect institutions.Thus, we will improve appeal and counseling mechanisms within the military, establish a fair and equitable incident investigation mechanism, and regularly evaluate personnel placements. In terms of education and training, we will strengthen leadership capacities across all levels of leadership and foster a modern management system that emphasizes professionalism.We need to strike a balance between the team-oriented military discipline needed for actual combat and society's respect for the individual.●Active International ParticipationOver the past four years, we have actively taken part in addressing major global issues, including counter-terrorism cooperation, humanitarian assistance, religious freedom, and nontraditional security.Throughout this global pandemic, we have been praised for providing selfless assistance to the international community wherever we are able.Taiwan has been deemed a democratic success story, a reliable partner, and a force for good in the world by the international community. All Taiwanese people should take pride in this.Over the next four years, we will continue to fight for our participation in international organizations, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with our allies, and bolster ties with the United States, Japan, Europe, and other like-minded countries.We will also participate more actively in regional cooperation mechanisms and work hand-in-hand with countries in the region to make concrete contributions to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.●Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsIn the face of complex and changing cross-strait circumstances, we have made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait over the past four years, gaining approval from the international community. We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security.Here, I want to reiterate the words ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue."" We will not accept the Beijing authorities' use of ""one country, two systems"" to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle.We will continue to handle cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. This has been our consistent position for maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Cross-strait relations have reached a historical turning point. Both sides have a duty to find a way to coexist over the long term and prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences. Faced with changing circumstances, I will hold firm to my principles, adopt an open attitude to resolve issues, and shoulder my responsibilities as President. I also hope that the leader on the other side of the Strait will take on the same responsibility, and work with us to jointly stabilize the long-term development of cross-strait relations.While we work to achieve national development, it is crucial that we optimize our government institutions over the next four years. Our Legislative Yuan will establish a constitutional amendment committee, giving us a platform to engage in dialogue and reach a consensus on constitutional reforms pertaining to government systems and people's rights.This democratic process will enable the constitutional system to progress with the times and align with the values of Taiwanese society. Our first priority should be to lower the voting age from 20 to 18, an issue on which both the majority and opposition parties are in agreement.In terms of judicial reform, I delivered on my promise to convene a National Congress on Judicial Reform, and we completed amendments to the Judges Act, the Attorney Regulation Act, the Constitutional Court Procedure Act, and the Labor Incident Act. This is all base work for the further improvement of our judicial system.However, our judicial reforms are still in transition, and our current progress has not yet met the public's expectations. I will continue to solicit opinions from across society and keep pressing forward. The people's dissatisfaction drives us to continue on the path of reform.Within the next four years, we need to implement a lay judge system, so that citizens can act as lay judges in court and become catalysts for judicial reform. This will help bridge the distance between the people and our judicial system, so that it aligns better with their expectations and earns their trust.All constitutional institutions must also continue on the path of reform. The Executive Yuan will reevaluate and reinitiate its organizational reform process, including the establishment of a specialized digital development agency and adjustments to all ministries in line with current needs. This will enable governance capabilities to be more responsive to the needs of national development.The National Human Rights Commission under the Control Yuan will officially be established in August of this year. This will be a milestone in our journey to place human rights at the center of Taiwan's national ethos, and marks the start of a new chapter for the Control Yuan.Our new Examination Yuan team will be instated in September, and I will ask them to propose a comprehensive reform plan and evaluate past policies, so that they can become an effective human resource department that can cultivate the talent a modern government needs.My fellow citizens, over the past 70 years, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has grown more resilient and unified through countless challenges. We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation. We have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Although we were once isolated in the world, we have always persisted in the values of democracy and freedom, no matter the challenges ahead of us. We will always remain committed to our common belief: Taiwan must help ourselves to help others, and when we help ourselves, others will help us.Many of the heroes in our fight against COVID-19 are here with us today, including members of our national face mask team, our Central Epidemic Command Center's public health team, and Premier Su Tseng-chang's team.There are many more heroes from all walks of life not in attendance today: medical workers, postal workers, pharmacists, convenience store clerks, taxi drivers, and many more.I may not be able to call out all of your names, but I want everyone to know that Taiwan has overcome countless challenges over the past 70 years, relying on not just one or two heroes, but thanks to countless heroes such as yourselves, working together to turn the wheels of history. You have helped make Taiwan a happy, safe, and prosperous place for generations to come.I want to express my respect to all of you. Every single person in Taiwan is a hero. Vice President Lai and I are honored to take on the responsibility you have entrusted to us.Taking on the responsibility of the President of the Republic of China in such difficult times brings me more pressure than joy. But I will not back down, because all of you are with me.The path forward will not be easy, and greater challenges await us. But we are a country that has persevered through even the greatest hardships. We, the 23 million people, have always been and will always be a community with a shared destiny.I truly hope that all of my fellow citizens will remember how it felt to come together to overcome the challenges of the past few months. The Republic of China can be united. Taiwan can be safe. Being Taiwanese can be an honor that makes you hold your head high.My dear citizens, the path ahead of us is long, and we are about to begin a new chapter in Taiwan's story. Taiwan's story belongs to each and every one of us, and it needs each and every one of us.I ask that the 23 million people of Taiwan act as our guides and partners. Let us pool our wisdom and courage and make this country a better place together. Thank you.（For the full text in Mandarin: 最特別的就職典禮 蔡總統：感謝台灣人民【演說全文】）",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005200003

5/22/2020,A new 'internet for everything' era on the way: expert,"By Kay Liu, CNA staff writerThe global COVID-19 pandemic has upended people's lives, giving terms such as stay at home, work from home, and social distancing added resonance and accentuating the importance of the internet in connecting with others and doing one's job.What many are wondering is if these lifestyle changes will become entrenched and workplaces permanently altered even as the pandemic eases and people can move freely again.Kenny Huang, the chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), says the trends are here to stay, and he foresees a world of ""internet for everything,"" in which even more tasks will be done online.""Before the pandemic, the internet was an information technology tool. For businesses, it was used to help with operations, marketing or other areas. But in the post-COVID-19 era, all business activities will likely be connected to the internet,"" Huang said in a recent interview with CNA.Huang is in as good a position as anybody to look into the future of cyberspace.His TWNIC, which manages domain names ending with .tw and internet protocol (IP) addresses in Taiwan, routinely conducts surveys and issues reports on internet use that offer insights into trends and developments in the online world and help businesses make decisions.He believes COVID-19 has already made the internet part of a new reality because people no longer feel that things have to be done face-to-face, at least judging by the surge in online traffic and bandwidth he has observed from Dec. 30, 2019 to March 23.Huang estimates that the internet is used in about 10 percent of everyday work at present, but he expects that to go much higher in the future as habits change.Possible risksThe increasingly internet-dependent world that Huang envisions could have a downside, however, with risks that already exist such as threats to cybersecurity or the monopolization of information potentially magnified, he said.He pointed to the possibility of a wider spread of disinformation if people become more reliant on digital media as a news source.""There are always new solutions, but there will always be new types of disruptions,"" said Huang, who used the example of fake news evolving from pure fiction to mixing in some facts to create misinformation.The new solutions, he said, are the likes of the review mechanism introduced by Facebook and Twitter and the work of organizations such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center.Social mediaSocial media could also fall prey to the growing importance of the internet, Huang suggested.At its core, the internet is about transmitting data and connecting devices, while social media plays the role of ""connecting people, who share and exchange the knowledge and views they have,"" he said.Interactions online may mirror those in the real world, but they are not perfect reflections, he said.They could become even more imperfect as reliance on the internet means users gravitate to only a few major service providers, and those platforms' user agreement and rules become, in effect, the rules of society, Huang cautioned.According to the center's annual Taiwan Internet Report for 2019, 79.2 percent of those surveyed between September and November last year used online social media, of whom 98.9 percent used Facebook, 38.8 percent used Instagram and only 5.6 percent used Twitter.Security concernsBehind the changing of habits seen during the global pandemic, the introduction of fifth generation wireless technology (5G) could also profoundly affect user habits by offering accessible, fast internet access at an affordable price.But its arrival has posed a challenge to Taiwan's government that may dominate the debate over cyberspace in the post-COVID-19 world -- balancing an open ecosystem with security concerns.In terms of 5G, the existing internet environment could make it easy for just a few companies to become dominant players, and they may be foreign and even hostile to Taiwan's interests. That has led Taiwan's government to intervene in the 5G arena by banning the use of essential equipment from certain suppliers or countries, especially China, on the grounds of national security, Huang said.Such fears have extended into other areas, including to internet services, he said, citing the example of China-based video-conferencing service Zoom, which has soared in popularity during the pandemic but was banned in Taiwan for government and school use over security concerns.Yet the government has not been as interventionist in other social or commercial domains, Huang said, citing the example of the growing popularity of foreign online streaming services that are full of content from China.The TWNIC report found that 84.5 percent of those surveyed watched online video or streamed content, 76.3 percent of which was produced in Taiwan, followed by China (42.2 percent), the United States (38.2 percent), Japan (35.2 percent), South Korea (34.4 percent) and Europe (13.2 percent).Striking a balance between free speech and China's attempts to use cultural power to spread its message in Taiwan will not be easy for the government, Huang said.Personal protectionMeanwhile, Huang warned that we all, at some level, will have to be prepared for the pitfalls of being heavily reliant on the online world.Shutdowns of service ""have happened and could still happen, and the impact on us will only increase because the time we spend and our reliance on internet services is growing,"" he said.""When using online services, people need to think ahead and have a plan B in case a company shuts down operations. Everyone should back up data routinely, update online accounts, update passwords, and not allow cookies when browsing online when they are not necessary,"" he advised.Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005220009

5/22/2020,Global support for Taiwan at record high: former U.S. official,"Washington, May 21 (CNA) Randall G. Schriver, a former United States assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said Thursday that Taiwan has won huge global support because of its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, despite China's suppression.""Taiwan's international recognition, international admiration for Taiwan, international support for Taiwan has almost never been higher, because we see the juxtaposition of how the PRC has handled the coronavirus and how Taiwan has,"" Schriver said at a virtual conference hosted by the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.Schriver also berated China for poaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies and seeking to exclude Taiwan from global bodies like the World Health Organization.The Communist Party of China's ""approach to Taiwan has failed, not by my measure but by their own measure,"" he said in the forum, titled U.S.-Taiwan Relations and Taiwan's Evolving Role in the Global Order.As a result of China's failed policies, it has destroyed any pathway for what it calls peaceful reunification and any remaining constituency for a future ""one China,"" Schriver said.China's proposed 'one country, two systems' unification framework ""never had much of a constituency in Taiwan, but polls now regarding what aspirations people have for a future arrangement ... have never been worse from China's perspective,"" he said. ""So it is very difficult to see re-sinification of Taiwan through peaceful means.""In light of that situation, Schriver said, the U.S. should be concerned about a growing temptation on the part of China to use more military tools and coercion against Taiwan.Under such circumstances, the U.S. and Taiwan should strengthen cooperation in the field of information sharing, he said, adding that he supports U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to help boost its defense capability.Also at the forum, Evan Medeiros, Penner Family chair in Asian studies and the Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations, said it is becoming more difficult for the U.S. to strike a balance in supporting Taiwan while seeking to build a constructive relationship with China, given that China is growing more confident in East Asia, and Taiwan is facing increasing pressure and coercion from Beijing.Medeiros said the U.S. should take its security pledge to Taiwan seriously, sell Taiwan more weapons based on the Taiwan Relations Act, and help Taiwan join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Chin-yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005220011

3/2/2020,Taiwanese seeking jobs in Philippine gambling sector urged to be cautious,"Taipei, March 1 (CNA) The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) on Sunday advised Taiwanese applying for work in the Philippines gambling industry to exercise caution, saying many companies in that sector are operating outside the law.In a press release, the CIB said gambling in the Philippines is legal only within designated areas, and many companies running that kind of business do not have the required government permits.Many Taiwanese employees in illegal online gambling businesses in the Philippines become embroiled in disputes over pay and suffer physical abuse, while some are abducted and their families are asked to pay a ransom for their release, the CIB said.The CIB said that in the first two months of the year, its liaison officer in Manila, in cooperation with Philippine law enforcement, rescued three Taiwanese employees in the gambling business who had been abducted.The figures for such cases were 12 in 2019 and 11 in 2018, the CIB said, adding that in some cases, the Taiwanese employees had fallen victim to loan sharks.People, therefore, are warned to be cautious when seeking jobs in the gambling business in the Philippines, the CIB said, citing the recent case of a Taiwanese being allegedly abducted and beaten after he got into a dispute with the illegal gambling company at which he was employed.The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in the Philippines received a call from the Taiwanese employee, appealing for help and saying also that his salary was being withheld, according to the CIB.Potential Taiwanese employees should carefully check the background of gambling enterprises in the Philippines before accepting jobs and should make sure they understand the terms of the work contracts, the CIB said.Those who do accept jobs in the gambling industry should ensure that when they arrive in the Philippines, the company would process their work visas, permits and other required documents, the CID advised.(By Huang Li-yun and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003020003
3/2/2020,Taichung company reopens after 2-week closure due to COVID-19 scare,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) A woodworking company in Taichung resumed work Monday after a two-week shutdown that was spurred by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and death in the family of one of its employees.All 58 of the company's employees were sent on leave and instructed to remain in home quarantine from Feb. 17 to March 1.After the two week period, the employees all tested negative for the COVID-19, and the company was allowed to resume operations on Monday, the Taichung Health Bureau said.The shutdown was spurred by the infection and subsequent death of a 61-year old private driver, Taiwan's 19th coronavirus case and first death, who was a relative of one of the company's employees.Before the man died on Feb. 16, he had infected four relatives during a family gathering on Jan. 27 -- his mother, sister and brother, and the husband of his niece.The woodworking company in the city's Tanzi District said Monday that its premises have been thoroughly disinfected and its employees will receive full pay for the two weeks they were in home quarantine.Meanwhile, a food processing factory in Taichung, at which the sister of the 19th patient was employed, also resumed work on Monday but said some of its workers were still in home quarantine.(By Hao Hsueh-chin, Chao Li-yen, Su Mu-chun and Ko Lin) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003020004

3/4/2020,TSMC teams up with Broadcom in 5nm process development,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has joined forces with U.S.-based integrated circuit designer Broadcom Inc. in advanced 5 nanometer process development.In a statement released Tuesday, TSMC said it has teamed up with Broadcom to strengthen the Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) integrated circuit packaging platform that supports 5nm technology.According to TSMC, CoWoS provides best-in-breed performance and highest integration density for high performance computing applications, and the particular wafer level system integration platform offers a wide range of interposer sizes, a number of high bandwidth memory (HBM) cubes, and package sizes.The cooperation with Broadcom means TSMC will provide one-stop services from IC packaging to pure wafer foundry services to Broadcom, which has come on board with other foreign tech giants such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Huawei Technolgies Inc., to use the Taiwanese chipmaker's 5nm process technology.In addition to contract chip production, TSMC has started high-end IC packaging operations in a bid to provide its customers with a wide range of comprehensive services.The 7 nanometer process is the latest technology the chipmaker has begun mass producing, while the company is also developing the more sophisticated 5mn and 3mn processes.TSMC is scheduled to launch mass production of the 5nm process in the first half of this year. The 3nm process is expected to begin commercial production in 2022.Through its partnership with Broadcom, TSMC's next generation CoWoS packaging services provide bandwidth of up to 2.7 terabytes per second, which is 2.7 times faster than the CoWoS solution the chipmaker previously offered in 2016.TSMC said with higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the CoWoS solution jointly developed with Broadcom is well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as deep learning, workloads for 5G networking and power-efficient data centers.At an investor conference held in mid-January, TSMC said the company expects to benefit from solid demand for smartphones, high performance computer (HPC) devices, Internet of Things related applications and automotive electronics this year.Amid optimism over global demand, TSMC has devoted itself to high-end technology development, a move expected to boost its global competitive edge and sustain the company's lead over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., which has started advanced technology processes with an eye to gaining a larger share of the global market.For the development of its high-end processes, TSMC has said capital expenditure for 2020 is expected to range from US$15-16 billion, the highest level in the company's history.Currently, TSMC has more than 50 percent of the global pure wafer foundry market.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003040004

3/6/2020,Taiwan shares plunge on U.S. market volatility,"Taipei, March 6 (CNA) Taiwan shares moved sharply lower Friday morning after the U.S. markets plunged overnight on growing fears over the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States, dealers said.Investors scrambled to dump large cap stocks across the board, with the downturn led by tech heavyweights, such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, they said.As of 10:58 a.m., the benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) or the Taiex, had fallen 169.29 points, or 1.47 percent, to 11,345.53 on turnover of NT$85.07 billion (US$2.84 billion).""The market was battered by panic selling soon after it opened, as investors saw an almost 1,000 point dive on the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight,"" Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su said. The Dow plunged 3.58 percent Thursday.""Market sentiment here was moved by a soaring VIX on the U.S. markets as investors at home and abroad feared the COVID-19 spread in the U.S., the largest economy in the world, will further affect the global economy.""The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX), which is widely considered an ideal gauge of fear in the market, soared about 14 percent overnight.The spread of the COVID-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has undermined production in China and interrupted global supply chains. The contagion could also hurt private consumption in the U.S.Since the novel coronavirus first emerged at the end of December, more than 96,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with infections in more than 80 countries and territories and more than 3,300 deaths, the majority of which have been in China.""Such unfavorable circumstances are expected to pose threats to Taiwan's export-oriented economy,"" Su said.It was no surprise that Friday's selling in Taiwan focused on the bellwether electronics sector, which depends heavily on global demand, Su said.As of 10:58 a.m., TSMC had lost 2.01 percent to NT$316.50 with 25.07 million shares changing hands after its American depositary receipts (ADRs) lost 2.37 percent on U.S. markets overnight.Led by TSMC, the electronics sector was down 1.43 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index was down 1.76 percent.Also in the high tech sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had lost 1.93 percent to NT$81.10, while Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., was little changed at NT$4,600.00.Following a 1.45 percent fall in its ADRs overnight, integrated circuit packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. had lost 2.99 percent to NT$71.40, while IC designer MediaTek Inc. had lost 1.17 percent to NT$380.50.Selling was also seen among large cap old economy stocks with Formosa Plastics Corp. down 1.61 percent at NT$91.80 and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 2.15 percent at NT$68.20.In the financial sector, Fubon Financial Holding Co. had fallen 1.88 percent to NT$44.30, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. had lost 1.37 percent to NT$39.60.""The silver lining was that the magnitude of the fall in the local market was not as heavy as elsewhere in the world as the TWSE remained awash in liquidity and many investors appeared willing to park their money here,"" Su said.""I expect the Taiex will see strong support at around the 240-day moving average of 11,049 points,"" Su said.

3/13/2020,Stabilization fund ready to shore up equity market: MOF,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Finance Minister Su Jain-rong (蘇建榮) on Friday said the National Financial Stabilization Fund is ready to lend support to the local equity market and its committee could meet at anytime if necessary, amid global volatility spurred by escalating fears over the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 worldwide.At a news conference held at around 8:15 a.m., 45 minutes before the local equity market opened, Su urged investors to remain confident in Taiwan's economic fundamentals, saying the Ministry of Finance, the central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission will come up with measures to stabilize the stock market.Su made the comments as concerns over the spread of COVID-19 intensfied, sending ripples through global financial markets.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,352 points or almost 10 percent, the largest single session drop since Oct. 19, 1987, when the index shed 22.6 percent amid a global financial crisis, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index also dropped more than 9 percent even though the U.S. Federal Reserve took the unusual step of injecting funds into the market.Despite Su's remarks, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taiex still opened down 331.29 points at 10,091.03 and the weakness continued on panic-led selling across the board.Su said the stabilization fund is watching the local equity market closely and its committee could meet anytime, if necessary, and jump into the market to counter the impact of global volatility.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.The fund intervenes in the market when it receives authorization from the fund committee, which is currently managed by Vice Finance Minister Juan Ching-hwa (阮清華), who is executive secretary of the fund.However, Su said with the virus, originally from the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading worldwide, it is no surprise that the global economy faces severe challenges with plunging equity markets around the world.In addition to the dive on the U.S. markets, the equity markets in France, Germany and the United Kingdom also tumbled 12.28 percent, 12.24 percent and 10.87 percent, respectively, Thursday.Compared with the markets in the U.S. and Europe, Juan said, Taiwanese equities appear resilient despite the ongoing scare over the virus. He cited data from Feb. 24 to March 12, showing that the Taiex fell 10.82 percent, while the Dow dropped 26.88 percent, and the markets in France, Germany and the U.K. shed 32.93 percent, 32.54 percent and 29.26 percent, respectively.The relatively small drop in Taiwan came as the country has executed efficient and effective measures to contain the spread of the virus, Juan said, adding that healthy economic fundamentals and attractive dividend yields in the equity market have enabled Taiwanese stocks to fend off unfavorable external factors to some extent.""It is unnecessary for investors to panic,"" Juan said, ""They should have faith in the local equity market.""(By Wu Chia-jung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003130003

""The local equity market has been battered by external factors instead of fundamental problems for the moment and it is too early to say when the market will stage a meaningful technical rebound despite some bargain hunting.""Among the falling tech heavyweights, TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock on the local market, had shed 3.91 percent at NT$282.50 after hitting a low of NT$272.50, with 85.16 million shares changing hands.""I think TSMC and other large cap stocks have been supported by government-led funds in a bid to prevent the Taiex from falling further and to bolster market confidence,"" Tang said.The stabilization fund will enter the market only if the fund's committee meets and issues an order for intervention.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.Also in the electronics sector, which had fallen 5.38 percent as of 11:56 a.m., iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had shed 4.02 percent at NT$71.70, but came off a low of NT$69.90 on bargain hunting.When Hon Hai shares fell to NT$69.90, the stock's market cap fell below the NT$1 trillion level reaching NT$969 billion as investors took their cue from recent sell-offs of the stock by foreign institutional investors, which registered net sales of 88.26 million shares in the previous five sessions, dealers said.Terry Gou (郭台銘), founder of Hon Hai, told reporters on Thursday that progress in reopening the company's sprawling production sites in China after the Lunar New Year holiday is ahead of schedule.Hon Hai is one of the largest investors in China with a workforce of more than 1 million.Last week, Hon Hai Chairman Liu Young-way (劉揚偉) said production at the company's factories has met more than 50 percent of demand in the current quarter, a traditionally slow season for the electronics industry, since production resumed after the holiday.Bargain hunters also bought into integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc., which had lost 3.13 percent at NT$325.50 after hitting a low of NT$305.50, as of 11:56 a.m., while shares in Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc. had fallen 2.76 percent at NT$3,890.00, off an early low of NT$3,620.00.In the petrochemical sector, which was hit by falling international crude oil prices, down 7.48 percent, Formosa Plastics Corp. had lost 6.90 percent at NT$78.20, Nan Ya Plastics Corp. had fallen 7.99 percent to NT$58.70, and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. shed 8.82 percent at NT$70.30.""Unless the global virus contagion shows signs of easing, global volatility could continue and it is hard to say where the Taiex can find strong technical support anytime soon,"" Tang said.(By Chung Jung-feng, Pan Yi-ching and Frances Huang) Enditem",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003130006

3/28/2020,Extreme heavy rain alert issued for Taitung,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) An extreme heavy rain alert has been issued for Taitung County in southeastern Taiwan on Saturday due to the effects of a weather front, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).The CWB said precipitation on Orchid Island of Taitung is expected to become apparent and will continue into Saturday afternoon due to the weather front, warning people living in low-lying areas of floodwaters.The bureau has lifted a heavy rain warning it had previously imposed earlier Saturday for the areas south of Taoyuan City as the weather front is passing, but it warned of possible occasional heavy rainfall in northern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula in the south.Under the bureau's definition, heavy rain means accumulated rainfall of 80 millimeters or more within a 24-hour period or rainfall of 40 mm or more in an hour, while extreme heavy rain is defined as accumulated rainfall of 200 mm or more within 24 hours.Along with the rainfall brought by the weather front, an accelerating northeasterly wind system is expected to cool northern Taiwan down as temperature highs are forecast to fall to 21-24 degrees Celsius Saturday from about 30 degrees a day earlier.Daytime temperatures in central and southern Taiwan are expected to fall in a moderate pace to 27-28 and 29-30 degrees, respectively, on Saturday, from 31-32 degrees a day earlier, the CWB said.With the weather front intensifying, the CWB said, the mercury around Taiwan will fall further from Saturday night through early Sunday morning.The bureau forecast temperatures will dip to 15 degrees in northern Taiwan, 16-17 degrees in central Taiwan and 18-19 degrees in the south on Sunday.It urged the public to keep a close eye on a wide day-night temperature gap, in particular in central and southern Taiwan, and to stay warm.In addition, the CWB said, the wind system is also expected to bring in strong winds for the areas north of Tainan, eastern Taiwan including Orchid Island and Green Island, the Hengchun Peninsula, as well as the outlying Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands Saturday.Such low temperatures are expected to continue into Sunday but drier weather is likely, with only sporadic showers expected in northeastern Taiwan and the mountainous areas in the north, the CWB said.Meanwhile, air quality in the north as well as Yilan, Hualien and Taitung in eastern Taiwan and the outlying Matsu and Penghu islands were rated ""good"" on Saturday, while it was ""fair"" in central Taiwan, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south, as well as Kinmen, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said.(By Chen Chun-shuo and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003280001

3/28/2020,U.S. reportedly eyes curb of TSMC's supply to Huawei,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) The United States has been aiming to curb the supply of chips sold by contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to China's Huawei Technologies Co. through planned heavier sanctions against the Chinese telecom equipment giant, according to a Reuters report.The report said while tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating with both sides blaming each other for spreading the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Trump administration has a plan to introduce new measures to further restrict global chip sales to Huawei.Under the proposed new rules, the report, dated Thursday in Washington, said foreign companies that use U.S. production equipment to roll out their chips would be required to obtain a U.S. license ahead of sales of certain chips to Huawei, which was blacklisted last year.Citing unnamed sources, the report said the measures are aimed at curbing supplies of chips to Huawei's integrated circuit design subsidiary arm HiSilicon Technologies Co. from TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.The report said it remained unknown whether President Donald Trump will approve the new sanction measures since he appeared to oppose the measures in February. If the new measures are imposed, Huawei and TSMC, as well as American enterprises, will feel the pinch, it said.The report quoted a research paper written by China-based Everbright Securities last year as saying most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials.""This is going to have a far more negative impact on U.S. companies than it will on Huawei, because Huawei will develop their own supply chain,"" trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said in the report. ""Ultimately, Huawei will find alternatives.""In Taipei, TSMC said it was unable to respond to any ""hypothetical questions"" and would not comment on any individual clients.According to a market estimate, Huawei accounts for about 10 percent of TSMC's total sales. Market analysts said if the strict rules are imposed, TSMC will see its shipments squeezed.After the possible heavier sanctions against Huawei surfaced, shares of TSMC gave up earlier gains of 2.14 percent on the Friday trading session in Taipei, falling 2.50 percent to close at NT$273.00 (US$9.03) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index also came off an earlier high of 9,954.86 points, down 0.38 percent to end at 9,698.92.On Friday, foreign institutional investors sold a net 5.23 million TSMC shares, stopping a three-day streak of a net buy, but for the entire week, such investors recorded a net buy of 28.47 million TSMC shares.TSMC's American depositary receipts on the U.S. market also fell 5.94 percent overnight as the market came under pressure amid fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.(By Emmanuelle Tseng, Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003280003

3/31/2020,All 214 evacuees from Hubei placed in quarantine,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The 214 Taiwanese nationals who returned to Taiwan on Monday night after being stranded in Hubei province by the new coronavirus outbreak have been placed in quarantine and will soon be tested for COVID-19.The passengers were taken by about a dozen tour buses to an undisclosed quarantine venue in northern Taiwan at around 1 a.m. Tuesday after undergoing health screenings at the airport, and will be quarantined for 14 days.Military servicemen chemically disinfected the vehicles after the passengers reached the quarantine facility.All returnees will be tested for COVID-19 within 48 hours, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center.The handling of these Taiwanese who were stuck in Hubei province after it went into lockdown in late January to contain the spread of the new coronavirus has been controversial.They were all put on a list of people who required special permission to return to Taiwan, unlike other Taiwanese currently returning from areas where the virus seems much more active, such as the United States and Europe.Those on the list are being required to return on special pre-arranged flights, which the government is describing as ""charter-like flights,"" and then put in quarantine in government-run facilities after arriving home.People arriving from other parts of China or other parts of the world can take regularly scheduled commercial flights to Taiwan and self-quarantine at home for 14 days.The 214 Taiwanese had to make their way on their own from Hubei province to Shanghai's Pudong International Airport to catch the special flight operated by China Airlines, which departed at 8:02 p.m. Monday and arrived at Taoyuan International Airport at 9:38 p.m.It was the second of two special flights contracted by the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a semi-official agency that handles cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in the absence of formal bilateral ties, to bring home Taiwan citizens stuck in Hubei.The first was arranged late Sunday, when 153 Taiwanese returned home.These Taiwanese had been stranded in Hubei since late January but were able to leave the area after restrictions on the movement of people there were lifted on March 25.Many others are still stuck in Wuhan, but will be able to leave if restrictions there are lifted on April 8 as scheduled.(By Liu Chien Pang and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310002

However, it was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.It has not been a member of the United Nations or the WHO since then.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310005
3/31/2020,Hon Hai shares edge higher on 2019 results,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker that churns out many of Apple's iPhones, moved higher Tuesday morning after it reported an increase in earnings per share (EPS) for 2019, dealers said.The gains were limited, however, as investors were wary of a fall in Hon Hai's profit margins amid escalating competition in the global market and concerns over a possible delay in the launch of the next generation iPhones amid the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.As of 11:38 a.m., shares of Hon Hai had gained 0.29 percent to NT$70.20 (US$2.32), off a high of NT$70.50, on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index was up 1.13 percent at 9,738.67 following gains in the U.S. overnight.In a statement released Monday, Hon Hai said it posted net profit of NT$115.31 billion in 2019, down 10.65 percent from a year earlier, but its EPS of NT$8.32 beat its EPS of NT$8.03 in 2018.Analysts said the EPS growth largely resulted from Hon Hai's move to cut its capitalization by about 20 percent in 2018 to NT$138.63 billion to maintain its EPS above the NT$8 level.It was the first time the company had lowered its capital since it first listed publicly in June 1991.Though EPS rose in 2019, the company's lower gross margin and operating profit margin fell due to intensifying global competition, giving investors pause.The company had a gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- of 5.91 percent in 2019, down 0.36 percentage points from a year earlier, and its net margin -- the difference between its gross profit and its total expenses -- was down 0.29 percentage points to 2.15 percent in 2019.Its operating profit margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- was also down 0.42 percentage points to 2.15 percent.In addition to cutting its paid-in capital, Hon Hai was also able to maintain its EPS above NT$8 in 2019 because of efforts to automate its production, a fall in the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, and a sharp decline in the losses of subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd.The Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, in which Hon Hai holds a 62.8 percent stake, cut its net loss to US$12.29 million in 2019 from US$857.12 million a year earlier because of efforts to keep costs down.Hon Hai had consolidated sales of NT$5.34 trillion in 2019, the highest in the company's history, but they were only up 0.92 percent from a year earlier.Hon Hai said it has scheduled an annual general meeting for June 23.Analysts have estimated that Hon Hai's sales in the first quarter of 2020 will fall 40 percent from NT$1.74 trillion in the fourth quarter to below NT$1 trillion because of slow season effects and falling demand caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.(By Chung Jung-feng and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310006

""So, we are here today calling for the MOL to mandate that dormitories be located away from the workplace to save the lives of migrant workers and firefighters.""Prior to the Taoyuan fire earlier this month, six Vietnamese migrant workers in Taoyuan City died in December 2017 in a factory fire that engulfed their dormitory, which was on the upper level of a factory warehouse made of sheet iron. The structure belonged to Sican Co., which runs a factory that produces solar control window film.Four months later, a blaze at a facility operated by Chin Poon, a printed circuit board factory in Taoyuan, claimed the lives of two Thai workers who were trapped in a dormitory on the factory premises, while six firefighters died in the rescue efforts.""The firefighters rushed into the burning factory because it was their duty to save lives,"" Chu Chih-yu (朱智宇), secretary general of the National Association for Firefighters' Rights, said at Tuesday's rally. ""But if people didn't live inside the factory, then the firefighters would not have had to put their lives on the line and enter the burning building.""The migrant workers at the rally, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, along with Taiwanese supporters, shouted slogans and burned incense at a makeshift altar in memory of those who had perished in the factory fires.A Filipino, who asked to be identified only as Arturo, said when he was working at a factory in Taoyuan last year, he was housed in a dorm in the basement of the building with nine coworkers.""There was once an earthquake and we felt extremely scared because there was only one exit from the basement. Imagine a fire -- we all would have been trapped,"" said Arturo, whose right hand was severed in a factory accident last year.Another Philippine worker said, however, that work safety is not the sole responsibility of the employer, and there is no guarantee that factory employees will be safe even if their dorms are offsite.""I have seen workers cooking in their rooms when they are not supposed to, plugging as many as 10 power adaptors to one outlet in the wall, and bringing cellphones into the work area,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named.Common sense is what is most important when it comes to safety, she said, adding that she works with toxic, flammable and combustible materials on a daily basis.In response to the protesters' calls, Huang Wei-cheng (黃偉誠), a section chief at the MOL's Workforce Development Agency, said the ministry is planning to amend the law to make it mandatory for factories that have onsite dorms to file safety reports, which would include a declaration of any pyrophoric substances or flammable gases on the site.The legislation, which is expected to be completed by June, will also state how often safety checks will be carried out at factories, according to a statement issued later by the MOL.Hsu, however, expressed skepticism about such safety checks, saying that there are some 100,000 dormitories throughout Taiwan for migrant workers, while the number of inspectors responsible for checking on the welfare of the workers totals only 274.""Work safety and the general welfare checks are usually carried out once, when a migrant worker first arrives in Taiwan, due to a lack of manpower,"" Hsu said.Among the 719,847 migrant workers in Taiwan, 455,934 are employed in the industrial sector, according to MOL statistics valid as of the end of February.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310011

As a result, TSMC's market capitalization returned to the NT$7 trillion level at NT$7.1 trillion, up from Monday's NT$6.86 trillion.Led by TSMC, the bellwether electronics sector closed up 1.32 percent and the semiconductor sub-index ended up 1.72 percent.Despite the spike in the semiconductor sub-index, shares in integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. fell 2.67 percent to close at NT$327.50 amid worries over the lockdown in India, one of the Taiwanese firm's major markets, due to the virus contagion.Also in the electronics sector, PC brand Asustek Computer Inc. rose 5.96 percent to close at NT$204.50 on hopes that its notebook computer and tablet computer shipments will receive a boost with many companies worldwide asking employees to work from home.Meanwhile, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. bucked the upturn, coming off an early high to close down 0.14 percent at NT$69.60 after the company reported a day earlier a fall in its gross margins for 2019 in the wake of escalating global competition.""Despite the gains enjoyed by select large cap tech stocks, certain old economy and financial stocks came under pressure as investors remained bothered by further possible global volatility despite the Dow's latest upturn,"" Huang said.Shocked by a plunge in international crude oil prices, investors dumped petrochemical stocks with Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 1.62 percent to close at NT$54.70, Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. down 1.03 percent to end at NT$67.00, and Formosa Plastics Corp. down 0.13 percent to close at NT$75.10.However, Wei Chuan Foods Corp. soared 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$19.95 on the back of the company's relatively high dividend yield.In the financial sector, which ended down 0.54 percent with banks' interest spreads falling, Cathay Financial Holding Co. fell 1.40 percent to close at NT$35.30, and Fubon Financial Holding Co. dropped 0.92 percent to end at NT$37.55.""There are no signs the global virus spread will ease anytime soon so many investors remained reluctant to chase prices for the moment,"" Huang said.

3/31/2020,Bank heist suspect nabbed in Taoyuan,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A suspect who got away with NT$800,000 (US$26,429) after robbing a Bank of Panhsin branch in Taipei a day before was arrested in Taoyuan Tuesday.According to local police, the robber was caught at around 3 p.m. in front of a convenience store on Zhongxing Road in Longtang District.At the scene of the arrest, officers also found an assault rifle that he used to carry out the crime, as well as NT$600,000 in cash stashed in his car.Investigators are currently still questioning him as to his motive, including the whereabouts of the remaining missing money.The robbery took place early Monday, when he threatened two female bank clerks by firing five shots into the ceiling and ordering them to put the money into his green duffle bag.He also shot a security guard stationed at the bank in the leg.The robber then made off in a taxi that he stole outside the Zhishan MRT Station in Shilin prior to carrying out the heist.The vehicle was later found ditched on Wenhua Road in the Linkou area west of Taipei.Police immediately began looking for the suspect through surveillance cameras and finally tracked him down in Taoyuan City Tuesday.(By Huang Li-yun and Ko Lin) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310014
3/31/2020,Transgender activists release 7 policy demands,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Activists marked Tuesday's International Transgender Day of Visibility by announcing seven policy demands based on what they called the largest-ever survey of Taiwan's transgender community.At a press conference, the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) announced the results of the survey, which was open to respondents who identify as transgender under the broad definition of the term -- those whose gender identities or expressions differ from what is typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.The survey, which was conducted online March 14-25, received 518 valid responses, which served as the basis for the seven policy proposals, the TAPCPR said.The alliance's first two demands were to end the practice of requiring sex reassignment surgery for people seeking to change the gender designation on their national identification cards, as well as allowing coverage of elective sex reassignment surgeries under Taiwan's National Health Insurance program.According to a 2013 report on Taiwan's implementation of human rights by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the former requirement could constitute a form of torture, the group said.These concerns were further borne out in survey results, the TAPCPR said, in which 30.42 percent of the respondents said they were unsure about the safety of such surgeries, 29.54 percent doubted their necessity and 52.3 percent considered them prohibitively expensive.In its third and fourth demands, meanwhile, the group called for acceptance of the transgender community's collective diversity and for reforms of Taiwan's gender designation policies based on consultations with the transgender community.As an example of this diversity, the group cited survey results showing that 52 percent of the respondents identified as either male or female, while 48 percent identified themselves as nonbinary, gender-fluid or agender.Given the complexity of gender identity revealed in the survey results, the government should abandon the poorly received ""third gender policy"" it proposed in 2017, and instead should adopt new guidelines based on consultations with the transgender community, the alliance said.Fifth, the alliance called for an abolition of legal distinctions between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages.Because Taiwan's marriage equality law was passed as a special act rather than a revision of the Civil Code, which governs opposite-sex marriage, the legal rights enjoyed by the two forms of marriage vary, with a disproportionate impact on transgender individuals, the group said.For example, if a person married under the Civil Code seeks to change their gender designation and have their marriage recognized under the marriage equality act, they lose the right to adopt children as a couple and can only adopt their partner's biological children as a step-parent, the group said.On a broader social level, the alliance recommended starting gender identity education beginning in elementary school as a way of pre-empting the experience of the 47.68 percent of survey respondents who said they were bullied, discriminated against or otherwise mistreated at school.Similarly, the government should include transgender people in its monitoring of hate crimes, given that 37.3 percent of those surveyed said they had suffered workplace discrimination, the alliance said.Overall, the survey respondents reported suffering a wide range of social difficulties related to their gender identification.These included 55.41 percent who feared discrimination in public restrooms, 24.32 percent who delayed or avoided medical treatment and 22.01 percent who had been discriminated against while shopping for clothes or accessories.Another 18.53 percent said they had been sexually harassed or attacked in public, while 15.83 percent were afraid to call the police in an emergency, according to the survey results.(By Yang Su-min and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310015
3/31/2020,Constitutional Court hears debate on decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Grand justices heard arguments at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday on whether a criminal law that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after several judges asked for an interpretation of the law.Article 239 of Taiwan's Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.Eighteen judges and a male who was convicted of adultery have asked the Constitutional Court in recent years to overturn Interpretation 554, which determined that Article 239 was constitutional.The most recent one was a judge surnamed Chen (陳) from the Miaoli District Court who mainly hears cases related to ""offenses against marriage,"" who felt Article 239 may violate the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan).The court finally agreed to hear the case and heard arguments Tuesday, some of which centered around Interpretation 554.The interpretation, which was made in 2002, ruled that the freedom of sexual behavior is inseparably related to the personality of individuals, and every person is free to decide whether or not and with whom to have sexual affairs.Such freedom is, however, legally protected only if it is not detrimental to the social order or public interest as provided in Article 22 of the Constitution, and therefore the freedom of sexual behavior is subject to the restriction put on it by marriage and the family system, the ruling said.One of the judges arguing for decriminalization, Wu Chih-chiang (吳志強), said adultery is not the only factor that shakes a marriage and therefore there was no need to intervene with ""national punishment.""He argued that Article 239 could lead to unfairness and inequality in administering punishment, forcing people to maintain an unwanted marriage.Wu was referring to complaints by supporters of the decriminalization of adultery that under Article 239 the crime of adultery cannot be prosecuted without a complaint by the victim, and if one spouse withdraws charges against the other, the withdrawal does not apply to the outside party.That has led in practice to women likely to be pressured by their husbands to drop the charges against them during the proceedings, yet the cases against the mistresses go ahead.Judge Chang Yuan-sen (張淵森) argued that the purpose of criminalizing adultery was to protect the family and social morals and prevent people from suffering in a miserable marriage.Yet while the law gives people the ability to get married and divorced freely, it cannot use criminal law to ""threaten"" people into acting faithfully in a marriage, he contended.Many factors cause suffering in a marriage, including the relationship between the wife and her mother-in-law, child education problems, financial issues, and sexual relations, Chang said.""If one person suffers in a marriage, it does not mean the other party has to be punished. Suffering should not be a reason for punishment in the Criminal Code,"" he said.Chi Hui-jung (紀惠容), a former executive director of the Garden of Hope Foundation who attended the Constitutional Court as a friend of the court to present her opinions, called Article 239 a law that punishes women.Although there are more men charged for adultery than women, in the end more women, most of them the mistresses in the cases, are convicted, she said.At the same time, she argued, the crime of adultery uses the Criminal Code to deter people from having affairs, but in a society that now frowns on using corporal punishment to discipline children, it is inappropriate to use ""threats"" to keep marriages together.Deputy Minister of Justice Tsai Pi-chung (蔡碧仲) argued, however, that the criminalization of adultery is aimed at safeguarding the marriage and family system.To support her position, Tsai cited Interpretation No. 544, which says the root of the nation's marital system lies in the freedom of personality, with such social functions as the maintenance of the order of human relationships and gender equality, and the raising of children.To insure an enduring and unimpaired system of marriage, the state may of course enact relevant rules to require a husband and wife to be mutually bound to each other by the duty of faithfulness, the interpretation says.The freedoms of individuals should still be restricted by the need to maintain social order, Tsai argued, and therefore Article 239 is not unconstitutional.(By Lin Chang-shun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310016
3/31/2020,Prosecutors voice support for decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310017
3/31/2020,Taiwan further expands screening to curb COVID-19 pandemic,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Tuesday announced that it will expand the scope of COVID-19 coronavirus screening tests to all patients with pneumonia and those who have lost their sense of smell or taste, effective immediately.Henceforth, patients with such symptoms will be required to undergo coronavirus screening tests, said CECC expert Chang Shan-chwen (張上淳) during a news briefing.Chang said the CECC decided to expand screening to patients with pneumonia in the hope that doing so will make it easier to detect those infected with COVID-19 more quickly and before they infect others.The decision came after two of the most recent cases were individuals with no recent overseas travel history, who tested positive for coronavirus only after doctors sent their samples for screening following a pneumonia diagnosis, according to the CECC.As of Monday, 24 of the more than 300 confirmed cases in Taiwan were found to have lost their sense of smell or taste, prompting the CECC to subject those with such symptoms to screening, he added.Previously, Taiwan only conducted COVID-19 tests on those with respiratory symptoms and fever who had recently traveled to countries with coronavirus outbreaks, or who had contact with coronavirus patients.The CECC last week further expanded the scope of screening to medical and healthcare workers with suspected infection symptoms in order to prevent possible cluster infections in the nation's healthcare system.Taiwan recorded 16 new infections on Tuesday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 322 with five deaths since the coronavirus emerged in China at the end of last year, according to CECC statistics.As of Tuesday, the CEEC had conducted 31,800 tests since the epidemic started in late December.(By Chen Wei-ting, Yu Hsiao-han and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310018

3/31/2020,Taiwan's surgical mask output hits 13 million per day,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's daily surgical mask output has hit 13 million, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Tuesday.The current daily output is more than four times the amount that Taiwan was capable of producing in early February, when Taiwan produced an average of 3.2 million surgical masks per day.That amount, however, is far from enough to meet the demand for surgical masks, which are widely used in Taiwan to prevent against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.In response to the high demand, the government banned the export of all surgical masks in late January, requisitioned all domestically produced masks, and instituted a rationing system to limit the number of masks people could buy per week.It also purchased 92 mask production lines, which have been set up in 40 days and have largely contributed to the significant surge in output.With the increase in output, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced Monday that people would be able to buy more masks under the rationing system in April.From April 9, residents will have access to nine masks for adults every 14 days, up from three per week at present, while the quota for children's masks will remain at 10 every two weeks, the CECC said.The MOEA is also discussing whether to purchase production lines that can produce N95 masks, which are able to filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles and are mainly used by medical workers on the frontlines.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310020

""MOFA will continue to work with the U.S. and other like-minded countries to advance our shared values and common goals and deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership on the global stage.""The TAIPEI Act was first introduced in the U.S. Senate by Cory Gardner last May, with Republican Congressman John Curtis unveiling a similar version in the House of Representatives in October, amid Beijing's continued efforts to squeeze Taiwan's international space.The legislation was passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier this month and later signed into law by Trump.The Act calls on the U.S. government to further Taiwan-U.S. bilateral trade and economic relations, help Taiwan participate in international organizations, and strengthen Taiwan's partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific region and in the world, according to Ou.It also authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider altering its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious actions to undermine Taiwan's security and prosperity, she said.The Republic of China (Taiwan), a founding member of the WHO, was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.International support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.Taiwan has been trying to rejoin the WHO since 1997. From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was able to participate in the WHA as an observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" with Beijing's approval, as cross-Taiwan Strait relations were warmer at the time.Since 2017, however, the year after President Tai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) took office, the Chinese government has been blocking Taiwan's efforts to participate in the WHA, due to differences between Taipei and Beijing over the so called ""1992 Consensus.""The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China,"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310022

3/31/2020,Taiwan's COVID-19 response could reach NT$1 trillion: premier,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The Taiwan government's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could reach as much as NT$1 trillion (US$33 billion), Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) told a legislative hearing on Tuesday.Such a figure would more adequately reflect the global nature of the crisis than the NT$60 billion special budget the Executive Yuan proposed in February, when the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was mainly limited to China, Su said.In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee De-wei (李德維) asked Su to detail the timing and scale of response measures being planned by the government, inquiring whether it would seek anything on the scale of Singapore's recently announced S$48 billion (US$33.65 billion) stimulus plan.""The overall scale will likely be around NT$1 trillion,"" Su said, arguing that the size of various countries' response measures will vary based on a variety of factors.In the United States, for example, people use private, rather than public insurance, while Taiwan uses the National Health Insurance program. Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310025

4/12/2020,127 European parliamentarians support Taiwan's WHA bid,"Taipei, April 12 (CNA) In a series of letters, 127 European parliamentarians have expressed support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwan's foreign ministry said Saturday.One of the letters, dated April 8 and addressed to European Union High Representative Josep Borrell, was signed by 67 EU parliamentarians from six party caucuses, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said.""The WHO treatment of Taiwan as part of China has caused problems for Taiwan,"" according to a copy of the letter that was posted on Twitter by one of the signatories, former Poland Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga.Not only is Taiwan's democratically elected government barred from participation in the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), but Taiwanese experts are also arbitrarily prevented from attending the WHO's technical meetings, the letter stated.""In these difficult times, the substantial cooperation in areas such as medical supplies, research and development of vaccines between Taiwan, the EU and its Member States would be beneficial in order to curb the further spread of the pandemic and better prepare for any future outbreak,"" the letter reads.One of the other letters was signed by 60 legislators of the German Parliament on April 2 and addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been heavily criticized by the U.S. and several other countries for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to MOFA.Anita Schäfer, chairperson of the German-Chinese Association-Friends of Taiwan, wrote in that letter that the WHO's treatment of Taiwan was inconsistent with its organizational values, MOFA said.The foreign ministry expressed appreciation for the support of the 127 European parliamentarians, saying they were the ""voice of justice.""The empathy of those parliamentarians for Taiwan is in sharp contrast to Tedros' biased statements about Taiwan, MOFA said.Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist, should be impartial and professional on the matter of the Taiwanese people's health and welfare, MOFA said.Since Taiwan was expelled from the WHO in 1972, its participation in the WHA as an observer has been limited to an eight-year period, from 2009 to 2016, amid relatively warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations during that time.International support for Taiwan's bid to rejoin in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.(By Chen Yun-yu and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004120001

5/7/2020,U.S. secretary of state urges WHO chief to invite Taiwan to WHA,"Washington, May 6 (CNA) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday called on the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA), saying it is within a WHO director-general's power to do so.In a press briefing, Pompeo reiterated Washington's support for Taipei's participation as an observer in this year's WHA, the decision-making body of the WHO, which will be held online from May 18-19 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.""Today I want to call upon all nations, including those in Europe, to support Taiwan's participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly and in other relevant United Nations venues,"" he said.He also urged WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to invite Taiwan to the WHA, ""as he has the power to do, and as his predecessors have done on multiple occasions.""Pompeo was referring to the fact that Tedros' predecessor, Margaret Chan (陳馮富珍), had sent invitations to Taiwan to observe the WHA from 2009 to 2016.Asked to comment if he will consider sending an invitation to Taiwan during a WHO press event held in Geneva that day, Tedros did not answer the question, referring it instead to WHO Legal Counsel Derek Walton.Walton reiterated the WHO's stance that the WHO secretariat has no authority to make such a decision unilaterally as it is to be made by all 194 member states.""The involvement, if any, of observers from 'Taiwan, China' in that assembly is a question for the 194 member governments, it's their decision,"" he noted.He also said that a number of member states have already raised proposals to discuss the matter at this year's WHA.He continued that whether or not Taiwan is invited to the assembly this year, there are ""well-established arrangements"" for health experts from ""Taiwan, China"" to work with the WHO on technical health matters.Taiwan participated in the WHA meetings from 2009 to 2016 as on observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei"" amid warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations under the then-Kuomintang (KMT) administration, which prioritized reducing cross-strait tension and building friendly ties with Beijing.Since 2017, however, China has persuaded the WHO not to invite Taiwan, in line with its hardline stance on cross-strait ties after President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office in May 2016.Explaining its decision for not sending invitations to Taiwan since 2017, the WHO said in 2019 that ""previous invitations to the WHA have been issued on the basis of a 'cross-strait understanding,'"" and that the ""absence of such an understanding"" in recent years has resulted in the fact that no more such invitations have been issued.According to the WHO Constitution, although the specialized agency under the U.N. does not recognize observer status, the rules of WHA procedure give the WHO director-general the right to invite observers to the annual WHA meeting, provided that they are ""States that have made application for membership, territories on whose behalf application for associate membership has been made, and States which have signed but not accepted the Constitution.""In response to Pompeo's remarks, Taiwan's foreign ministry on Thursday expressed gratitude, saying that it will continue to work closely with the U.S. and other like-minded countries in sharing Taiwan's success in containing the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The ministry also issued a protest over Walton's remarks that called the nation ""Taiwan, China,"" saying the designation belittled the nation's sovereignty.  (By Stacy Hsu, Tang Pei-chun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005070004

He was 96.Chung's son Chung Yen-wei (鍾延威) told reporters that the family found Chung not breathing around 7 p.m. Saturday.Chung Yen-wei said despite his father's old age, he was in relative stable health over the years. The family is deeply saddened and shocked by Chung's sudden passing and is now preparing his funeral.Born in Taoyuan's Longtan district in 1925 during Japanese rule, Chung was widely considered the doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement,"" who was most famous for his works, ""The Dull Ice Flower (魯冰花),"" ""the Turbid Waters Trilogy"" (濁流三部曲) and ""the Taiwanese Trilogy"" (台灣人三部曲).His classics of Taiwanese literature depicts the lives and fates of Taiwanese against the background of post-World War II Taiwan, following the end of the Japanese colonial period.In mourning the passing of Chung, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) expressed condolence to his family and said the passing of the nonagenarian literati is a great loss to the nation's literary circle.In a Facebook post, Tsai also praised Chung, an ethnic Hakka, for playing an import role in promoting Hakka culture and Taiwanese literature.Chung and other writers of his time had jointly published a regular newsletter in the post WWII era, the Literary Bulletin -- a periodical that proved essential to young and aspiring writers of that time, according to Tsai.Tsai said she will always remember Chung as an elder who saw her as his own child. She pledged to bear Chung's teaching in mind to continue the promotion of Hakka and Taiwanese culture so that Chung's legacy will last for generations to come.Asked to comment on Chung's legacy, writer Chen Fang-ming (陳芳明) told CNA that Chung had a tremendous impact toward the development of Taiwanese literature.Chung had played an crucial rule during the transitional period in the 1950s after the Kuomintang (KMT) had just taken over the governing of Taiwan from Japan at the end of Japanese colonial rule, according to Chen.Sincere condolences on the passing of #Hakka literary master Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政). The esteemed writer passed away on May 16 at the age of 96. https://t.co/zUbiiwwuCE pic.twitter.com/PH02BDFO0WAt that time, most Taiwanese could only speak Japanese and very few people could speak Mandarin, let alone write in the Chinese language. Chung was one of a handful of native Taiwanese writers of that time that can.Aside from focusing on his own works, Chung also published the Literary Bulletin that offered a platform for Taiwanese writers to publish their works.Chung's works had faithfully recorded the everyday lives of Taiwanese people of his time which showed his deep connection and affection toward his homeland, Chen noted.The Hakka Affairs Council, meanwhile, remembered Chung as not only a prolific writer but a devoted promoter of Hakka affairs who helped promote the awareness of Hakka culture to a national level, which successfully led to the creation in the 1990s of a dedicated Hakka language radio station.(By Chiu Chun-chin, Su Lung-chi Chen Ping-hung, Wu Hsin-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005170003

Those cases have not yet been classified as either local or imported, CECC data showed.To date, 395 COVID-19 patients in Taiwan have recovered, seven have died, with the remainder are still hospitalized, the CECC said in a statement.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 4,660,752 people in 187 countries and regions, including 1,489,642 in the United States, 272,043 in Russia, 240,161 in the United Kingdom, 230,698 in Spain and 224,760 in Italy, with a total of 311,064 fatalities, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.(By William Yen) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005170005
5/17/2020,Hostess club in Tainan reopens to customers amid COVID-19,"Tainan, May 17 (CNA) A hostess dance club in Tainan reopened Saturday, becoming the first such club in Taiwan's six major metropolitan areas to restart business after being shut down last month because of fears it could easily spread COVID-19.Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) said the city government issued a business resumption permit to the Wan Hsiang Dance Club (萬象舞廳) Friday after the club passed a government inspection.The 35-year-old Wan Hsiang Dance Club is so far the only legitimate hostess club among the five in the southern Taiwan city that has applied to reopen, according to Huang.City government officials said owners of the club pledged to implement the Central Epidemic Command Center's (CECC's) epidemic prevention guidelines against COVID-19 as it reopens its doors to customers.These guidelines include asking customers to follow social distancing measures, having them wear a face mask, taking their temperatures, and getting them to use hand sanitizer before entering the clubs.The club will also be required to control the flow of people by keeping a register of those entering, the city government said.The club's owners pledged to register the name and ID card numbers of each customer, and transparent plastic partitions have also been installed in each private booth to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Customers will also be forbidden to dance with a partner despite the resumption of operations, but will be allowed to dance alone, the club said, without elaborating.Huang said city officials will conduct inspections of the club to make sure it is following related guidelines, and the club will be closed for a week should violations be reported.Local media quoted the 75-year-old owner of the club surnamed Tseng (曾) as saying that the month-long suspension is the longest period of time the establishment has been closed during its 35-year history.The shutdown has seriously affected the livelihoods of the club's 100 employees and 200 hostesses, and they are all eager to see business resume, Tseng was cited as saying.The CECC on April 9 ordered hostess clubs across the country shut down, saying they posed a high risk of spreading COVID-19 after a hostess at a club in Taipei was confirmed to have the disease.As the number of cases dwindled to practically zero in the first week of May, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, announced on May 8 that local governments could decide whether to reopen their cities' hostess clubs under certain conditions.Tainan is the only one of Taiwan's six special municipalities -- which also include Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung -- to allow hostess bars to reopen so far.(By Chang Rong-hsiang and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005170006

5/17/2020,Taiwan advised to work with major economies after COVID-19,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan must seize the opportunity to work with major economies seeking to relocate global supply chains outside of China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic scholars suggested as President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) begins her second term on May 20.The pandemic, which has made many countries aware of their growing economic dependence on China for goods in several critical sectors, has led to calls to delink global supply chains of major industries from China.That trend offers an extremely good opportunity to Taiwan, said Ray Yang (楊瑞臨), consulting director of the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center (ISTI) under the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).He said the United States, China and Europe may all look to develop independent production capabilities in the post-COVID-19 world, and Taiwan has an opportunity to become an important partner for all of them.Yang said the U.S. will still be the world leader but cannot go it alone and will itself have to form partnerships with economies such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Taiwan is well positioned, Yang said, because the COVID-19 crisis has opened the world's eyes to the strengths of Taiwanese businesses, including their ability to respond quickly to different situations, high degree of flexibility and quality of manufactured goods.That was seen most clearly in Taiwan's ramping up of production of face masks and protective gear for medical workers to meet high demand during the coronavirus epidemic, he said.Meanwhile, Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, predicted that the U.S. economy would recover faster from the coronavirus pandemic than China.That trend has already prompted more Taiwanese businesses operating overseas to increase investment in Taiwan and reduce investment in China and other countries, Chiu said.Chiu also contended it will be in Taiwan's interests if the United States create an alliance of ""trusted partners"" to restructure supply chains away from China, as has been reported.According to a Reuters report in early May, the alliance would apply common standards for everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to trade, education and commerce, with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, India and Vietnam among potential partners.Though Taiwan is not on the list of ""trusted partners,"" it is a reasonable assumption that Taiwan has an opportunity to be included in the next phase given that Taiwan is considered a partner in the U.S.'s ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,"" Chiu said.""We must let the United States know that Taiwan can make its planned supply chains more complete,"" Chiu said, pointing to Taiwan's semiconductor industry's advantage in wafer fabrication and packaging and testing technology, which would help build the U.S.'s IC design capabilities.Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises' strength in producing spare parts and component production could also strengthen those new supply chains, Chiu said.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wu Po-wei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005170008
5/17/2020,Norwegian expats celebrate National Day with parade in Taiwan,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Norwegian expatriates in Taiwan held a parade and a flag-raising ceremony Sunday to celebrate Norway's National Day in what may have been the only parade around the world marking the occasion this year.More than a dozen Norwegians, some with their families, and about 60 members of the Taiwan Digital Diplomacy Association (TDDA), participated in the 40-minute parade that started in Daan District in Taipei and ended at the Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab, where the flag-raising ceremony was held.The activities were jointly organized by Norwegian nationals in Taiwan and the TDDA, a Taiwanese NGO dedicated to public diplomacy.""Interactions between Norway and Taiwan usually involve business or government issues. We hope today's event will bring the civil societies of the two countries closer,"" said TDDA Chairwoman Kuo Chia-yo (郭家佑), who began connecting with Norwegians in Taiwan three months ago.Other activities had been held in recent weeks to mark Norwegian National Day, including Norwegian cooking classes, a workshop on drawing a map of Norway, and a language-learning class, she said.Geir Yeh Fotland, a Norwegian born in Taiwan, told CNA that Norway's government has suspended all gatherings, including its National Day parade, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, making the Taipei event special.""I think this might be the only Norwegian National Day parade in the world, at least the longest with more than 60 people. So that's a great event,"" said Fotland, fondly called ""Norwegian grandpa"" by many Taiwanese who know him.Oslo is usually not keen on promoting Taiwan due to Beijing's influence in recent years, but major newspapers in Norway started to mention Taiwan in May because of its good performance in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, he said.""Taiwan has shown the world that we are independent from COVID-19 while the rest of the world is occupied by COVID-19, as Norway.""Oslo cut its official ties with Taipei in January 1950. Neither government has a liaison office on the other's soil after Oslo closed its trade office in Taipei in 2004 and Taipei closed its representative office in Norway in 2017.According to Fotland, there are about 10 Norwegian students and six to eight Norwegian nationals living in Taiwan, some of them retired and others here doing business.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005170009

5/17/2020,Rights group urges Taiwan to allow cross-national same-sex marriage,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) The Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) and several same-sex couples on Sunday urged Taiwan's government to allow same-sex marriages between couples from different countries.Taiwan's government legalized same-sex marriage in May 2019, becoming the first Asian country to do so.According to the Act Governing the Choice of Law in Civil Matters Involving Foreign Elements, however, a cross-national same-sex marriage can only be recognized in Taiwan if the countries of which the two partners are citizens both recognize same-sex marriage.The restriction discriminates against the LGBT community in Taiwan as marriage is a constitutional right, Pan Tien-ching (潘天慶), a lawyer from the TAPCPR, said at a press conference held near Taiwan's Presidential Office Building.Several cross-national same-sex couples lamented their difficult situations at the press conference.""For many cross-national same-sex couples, including me and my wife, our efforts to be with our loved ones are symbolized by our old plane ticket stubs,"" said Kaili Lai, a Taiwanese LGBT married to a Malaysian Tan Bee Guat.According to Lai, she and Tan held a simple wedding in Malaysia in 2016 with the blessings of their parents.Tan was not allowed to live in Taiwan, however because she was not a Taiwanese citizen and could not get a residence certificate because her marriage to Lai was not recognized.They had to fly frequently between Taiwan and Malaysia to see each other, leaving Tan little choice but to enroll in a university in Taiwan as a freshmen at the age of 35 to be able to stay in Taiwan on a student visa.But Tan is graduating next month and will have to enroll in a graduate school program to continue staying in Taiwan.Another cross-national same-sex couple, Joyce from Taiwan and Queenie from the Philippines, are facing the same predicament -- Queenie has to enroll in National Taiwan Normal University for the same purpose.According to the TAPCPR, the signature campaign it launched on May 9 to petition the government to amend laws that restrict same-sex marriage between such couples received 13,500 signatures and support from 20 human rights watchdogs in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Indonesia and the United States.The TAPCPR said it had written to relevant government units such as the Ministry of Justice, Mainland Affairs Council, National Immigration Agencies and the Ministry of Interiors on the issue.""Most government agencies have agreed that the issues need to be addressed but admitted that more coordination between relevant agencies is needed,"" the TAPCPR said as it urged President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to resolve the issue.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005170011

5/20/2020,Full text of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's second-term inaugural address,"Taipei, May 20 (CNA) The following is the full text of President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) inaugural address to start her second term, as released by the Presidential Office Wednesday:Vice President Lai, esteemed guests, friends watching on TV and online, my fellow citizens across the country, good morning.I feel immensely grateful to stand here once again today and take on the responsibility entrusted to me by the Taiwanese people.This inauguration ceremony is unique in the history of the Republic of China. What makes it special is not its size or the number of people in attendance. It is special because we know how difficult it has been for us to get to this point.I want to thank the people of Taiwan for making such a difficult feat possible.I particularly want to thank a group of people who have not received a lot of attention over the past four months in our fight against COVID-19. I want to thank every single person who waited in line outside of the pharmacy in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for trusting the government. You have shown the world Taiwan's commitment to civic virtues, even in times of greatest distress.I also want to thank everyone who was quarantined or isolated at home, putting up with inconvenience in your daily life to keep others safe and healthy. Thank you for exemplifying humanity's best qualities and helping us successfully bring the coronavirus outbreak under control.This sense of pride in our country, this community's shared destiny, and the memories of these past months will live on in all of our hearts. This is what solidarity feels like.Many ambassadors and representatives from other countries are here today, and I trust that many countries around the world are watching Taiwan as well.I want to take this opportunity to tell you that the country you see is populated by kind and resilient people. No matter the difficulties we face, we can always count on our democracy, our solidarity, and our sense of responsibility towards each other to help us overcome challenges, weather difficult times, and stand steadfast in the world.From January to now, Taiwan has amazed the international community twice. The first was our democratic elections, and the second was our success in the fight against COVID-19.In recent months, Taiwan's name has appeared in headlines around the world, thanks to our successful containment of the coronavirus outbreak.""Taiwan"" is also emblazoned on the boxes of supplies we are sending abroad. The Taiwanese people have the kindest hearts in the entire world, and we will always offer help to the international community whenever we are able.I hope that in addition to sharing in a sense of pride and joy, my fellow citizens can take to heart the spirit of ""helping ourselves to help others;"" ""when we help ourselves, others will help us.""This pandemic has not yet ended, and we must remain vigilant. Even when it ends, its impacts will linger on.The coronavirus has profoundly affected our world. It has changed the global political and economic order, accelerated and expanded the reorganization of global supply chains, restructured the global economy, and changed the way we live and shop. It has even changed the way the international community views Taiwan and developments in the surrounding region.These changes present us with both challenges and opportunities. I want to ask that my fellow citizens be prepared, because countless challenges and difficulties remain ahead of us.Over the next four years, only those who can end the pandemic within their borders, lay out a strategy for their country's survival and development, and take advantage of opportunities in the complex world of tomorrow, will be able to set themselves apart on the international stage.It takes more than fervor to govern a country. Leadership means calmly taking the right direction in a changing world. That is precisely what I have done over the past four years.I said before that I will leave you with a better country. So over the next four years, I will proactively develop our industries, foster a safe society, ensure national security, and deepen our democracy. I am going to reinvent Taiwan and lead our country into the future.1. Industrial and Economic DevelopmentI know that the Taiwanese people are most concerned about our industrial and economic development. In 2016, we initiated a new economic development model to help connect Taiwan's economy to the world. Over the past four years, despite massive changes in the international economy, Taiwan has done more than just weather the storm. Our economic growth has once again topped the Four Asian Tigers, and the stock market index now regularly breaks 10,000 points.Thanks to our successful control of the pandemic, so far, Taiwan is able to maintain positive economic growth. This is rare in the world. However, we need to continue to take early action on economic relief and revitalization, and do whatever it takes to maintain stable economic growth.Over the next four years, we will face more intense changes in the global economy and the accelerated reorganization of supply chains. We will continue to implement our Forward-looking Infrastructure Development and trillion NT-dollar investment programs. We will do so in the spirit of ""achieving growth through stability, and seizing opportunity amid changes,"" in order to secure Taiwan's economic development over the coming decades.In terms of industrial development, we are going to take advantage of the opportunities before us in six core strategic industries founded on our 5+2 Innovative Industries Program, to transform Taiwan into a critical force in the global economy.First, we will continue to develop our information and digital industries. We will take advantage of Taiwan's strengths in the semiconductor and ICT industries to secure a central role in global supply chains, and make Taiwan a major base for the development of next generation technologies, including IoT and AI.Second, we are going to develop a cybersecurity industry that can integrate with 5G, digital transformation, and our national security. We will strive to create cybersecurity systems and an industrial chain that can protect our country and earn the world's trust.Third, we are going to create biotech and medical technology industries integrated with the rest of the world. Throughout this pandemic, Taiwanese teams have proven that they are capable of working with world-class technologies to produce reagents and develop new drugs and vaccines. We are going to give these industries our utmost support, and transform Taiwan into a key force in the global battle against infectious diseases.Fourth, we are going to develop national defense and strategic industries by integrating military and civilian capabilities. In addition to domestically-produced naval vessel and aircraft programs that are currently underway, we will push harder to promote technological integration between the military and the private sector, to stimulate private sector production capabilities, and advance into the aviation and space industries.Fifth, we are going to accelerate the development of green energy and renewable energy industries. Over the past four years, renewable energy has experienced explosive growth, and Taiwan has become a hotspot for international investment. Building on this foundation, I am confident that we will achieve our goal of deriving 20% of our overall energy from green sources by 2025. We are going to make Taiwan a center for green energy in Asia.Sixth, we are going to establish strategic stockpile industries that can ensure the steady provision of critical supplies. Facing changes to the global order, we need to keep key industrial chains in Taiwan and maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the production of face masks, medical and daily supplies, energy, and food.In the current international climate, countries that end their dependence on others will have a head start on national development. I would like our friends across all industries to rest assured that our government stands with you. Over the next few years, we have several strategies to drive the growth of our industries.First, we will use domestic demand, particularly demand from the public sector and national security needs, as the basic engine for our industrial development.A prime example of this is the way strategic demand for face masks and other medical supplies throughout this pandemic has spurred the development of related industries. We can adopt a similar model for our national defense and renewable energy industries to help accelerate their development.We will continue to organize ""national teams,"" like our face mask team, according to the size and conditions of different industries. We will utilize our government's guarantee of domestic demand to establish a global strategic materials manufacturing industry under the ""Taiwanese brand"" and help it expand into other markets.We know that financial support is crucial to industrial development. Looking to the future, we will adopt more flexible financial policies, continue to reform financial systems, and use more diverse means to help industries obtain the financing they need.We will also work to create a safe environment for our industries. Our government is committed to maintaining sound public health and national security systems, a stable society, strong rule of law, and a healthy market. We need to offer these guarantees so that high-tech and strategic industries will be willing to choose Taiwan as their production and R&D base.We will also continue to guide the global expansion of our industries. We will keep working to sign trade or investment protection agreements with the United States, Japan, and European countries.As we continue to promote our New Southbound Policy, we will also develop other potential markets and encourage firms to establish operations there, giving our industries an edge when they engage in international cooperation. Overseas Taiwanese business communities around the world will be our best partners as we seek new international opportunities.Finally, we have the issue of talent. In order for Taiwan to become a key global economic force, we need a diverse talent pool. My government will bring in the world's top technical, R&D, and management talents to help globalize Taiwan's workforce, widen our industries' horizons, and give them the ability to compete in the international arena.Looking to the future, Taiwan must further connect with the international community. We will work to cultivate more outstanding bilingual and digital talents, giving our industries a global competitive edge.Over the next four years, Taiwan's economy will enter a new stage, complete with more flexible capital and talent flows, more robust industrial capabilities, and closer ties with the world. Together, we are going to enter a new era of shared prosperity.2. Safe Society: Health and Social Safety Nets to Catch Those Who Need HelpAs we develop our industries, we will also keep in mind that the people expect the government to foster a safe society. To be a better country, the government must take on more responsibilities to reduce the burden on the people and mitigate issues in society.Over the past few years, we have addressed Long-term Care 2.0, childcare, and residential justice issues. Over the next four years, my goal is to weave an even tighter net that can catch every single person who needs help and prevent future tragedies.●Health and Disease Prevention Safety NetFirst, we will strengthen our health and disease prevention safety net. Taiwan is an ageing society, and infectious diseases pose a serious challenge to the health of our people. That is why we need to bolster our disease prevention and treatment capabilities and link industries to make more breakthroughs in vaccine and new drug development, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, so that people can enjoy healthy lives and receive better care.●Mending Gaps in the Social Safety NetOur second step will be to mend the gaps in our social safety net. Over the past few years, a great deal of discussion has arisen around public safety incidents involving schizophrenia patients. The same goes for other mental illnesses, drug addiction, and domestic violence.I understand your concerns. These issues are not just the responsibility of individuals or families, they are the responsibility of the government. When families are unable to provide proper care, the government has a duty to step in and help.I am going to upgrade our social care system, enhance the capabilities of frontline social workers, and improve their work environments, so that they can work at the grassroots and identify people who have fallen through the gaps in our safety net.We cannot hold medical agencies or individual judges solely responsible for controversies surrounding specific cases. Our judicial and executive branches should reevaluate and optimize these systems and take initiatives to make any necessary legal amendments.3. National Security: National Defense Reforms, Active International Participation, Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsA better country requires a greater emphasis on national security. Over the past four years, we have pushed for national defense reforms, active international participation, and peaceful, stable cross-strait relations. We hope that Taiwan can play a more active role in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Over the next four years, the direction of our policies will remain the same, and we will do even more.●National Defense ReformsWe have three important directions for our national defense reforms. First is accelerating the development of our asymmetrical capabilities. While we work to bolster our defense capabilities, future combat capacity development will also emphasize mobility, countermeasures, and non-traditional asymmetrical capabilities. We will also work to strengthen our defenses against the threats of cyber warfare, cognitive warfare, and ""unrestricted"" warfare to achieve our strategic goal of multidomain deterrence.The second is substantive reforms to our military reserve and mobilization systems. We need to enhance the quality of our reserve forces, as well as their weapons, equipment, and training, in order to achieve effective jointness with our regular forces. We also need to establish a standing, interdepartmental system connecting our reserve and mobilization systems. This system will help coordinate personnel and supplies, so that we can successfully mobilize during a transition from peacetime to war.Third is improvements to our military's management institutions. Today's young servicemembers have all grown up in a democratic society, and one of our most important missions will be to find ways for them to better utilize their professional skills in line with military needs.Some young servicemembers have difficulties adjusting to military needs, reflecting the gap between today's society and our military management institutions. We need to work to close that gap. We need to reduce negative societal views of the military and end the gradual erosion of our military's prestige and morale due to individual incidents caused by imperfect institutions.Thus, we will improve appeal and counseling mechanisms within the military, establish a fair and equitable incident investigation mechanism, and regularly evaluate personnel placements. In terms of education and training, we will strengthen leadership capacities across all levels of leadership and foster a modern management system that emphasizes professionalism.We need to strike a balance between the team-oriented military discipline needed for actual combat and society's respect for the individual.●Active International ParticipationOver the past four years, we have actively taken part in addressing major global issues, including counter-terrorism cooperation, humanitarian assistance, religious freedom, and nontraditional security.Throughout this global pandemic, we have been praised for providing selfless assistance to the international community wherever we are able.Taiwan has been deemed a democratic success story, a reliable partner, and a force for good in the world by the international community. All Taiwanese people should take pride in this.Over the next four years, we will continue to fight for our participation in international organizations, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with our allies, and bolster ties with the United States, Japan, Europe, and other like-minded countries.We will also participate more actively in regional cooperation mechanisms and work hand-in-hand with countries in the region to make concrete contributions to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.●Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsIn the face of complex and changing cross-strait circumstances, we have made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait over the past four years, gaining approval from the international community. We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security.Here, I want to reiterate the words ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue."" We will not accept the Beijing authorities' use of ""one country, two systems"" to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle.We will continue to handle cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. This has been our consistent position for maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Cross-strait relations have reached a historical turning point. Both sides have a duty to find a way to coexist over the long term and prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences. Faced with changing circumstances, I will hold firm to my principles, adopt an open attitude to resolve issues, and shoulder my responsibilities as President. I also hope that the leader on the other side of the Strait will take on the same responsibility, and work with us to jointly stabilize the long-term development of cross-strait relations.While we work to achieve national development, it is crucial that we optimize our government institutions over the next four years. Our Legislative Yuan will establish a constitutional amendment committee, giving us a platform to engage in dialogue and reach a consensus on constitutional reforms pertaining to government systems and people's rights.This democratic process will enable the constitutional system to progress with the times and align with the values of Taiwanese society. Our first priority should be to lower the voting age from 20 to 18, an issue on which both the majority and opposition parties are in agreement.In terms of judicial reform, I delivered on my promise to convene a National Congress on Judicial Reform, and we completed amendments to the Judges Act, the Attorney Regulation Act, the Constitutional Court Procedure Act, and the Labor Incident Act. This is all base work for the further improvement of our judicial system.However, our judicial reforms are still in transition, and our current progress has not yet met the public's expectations. I will continue to solicit opinions from across society and keep pressing forward. The people's dissatisfaction drives us to continue on the path of reform.Within the next four years, we need to implement a lay judge system, so that citizens can act as lay judges in court and become catalysts for judicial reform. This will help bridge the distance between the people and our judicial system, so that it aligns better with their expectations and earns their trust.All constitutional institutions must also continue on the path of reform. The Executive Yuan will reevaluate and reinitiate its organizational reform process, including the establishment of a specialized digital development agency and adjustments to all ministries in line with current needs. This will enable governance capabilities to be more responsive to the needs of national development.The National Human Rights Commission under the Control Yuan will officially be established in August of this year. This will be a milestone in our journey to place human rights at the center of Taiwan's national ethos, and marks the start of a new chapter for the Control Yuan.Our new Examination Yuan team will be instated in September, and I will ask them to propose a comprehensive reform plan and evaluate past policies, so that they can become an effective human resource department that can cultivate the talent a modern government needs.My fellow citizens, over the past 70 years, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has grown more resilient and unified through countless challenges. We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation. We have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Although we were once isolated in the world, we have always persisted in the values of democracy and freedom, no matter the challenges ahead of us. We will always remain committed to our common belief: Taiwan must help ourselves to help others, and when we help ourselves, others will help us.Many of the heroes in our fight against COVID-19 are here with us today, including members of our national face mask team, our Central Epidemic Command Center's public health team, and Premier Su Tseng-chang's team.There are many more heroes from all walks of life not in attendance today: medical workers, postal workers, pharmacists, convenience store clerks, taxi drivers, and many more.I may not be able to call out all of your names, but I want everyone to know that Taiwan has overcome countless challenges over the past 70 years, relying on not just one or two heroes, but thanks to countless heroes such as yourselves, working together to turn the wheels of history. You have helped make Taiwan a happy, safe, and prosperous place for generations to come.I want to express my respect to all of you. Every single person in Taiwan is a hero. Vice President Lai and I are honored to take on the responsibility you have entrusted to us.Taking on the responsibility of the President of the Republic of China in such difficult times brings me more pressure than joy. But I will not back down, because all of you are with me.The path forward will not be easy, and greater challenges await us. But we are a country that has persevered through even the greatest hardships. We, the 23 million people, have always been and will always be a community with a shared destiny.I truly hope that all of my fellow citizens will remember how it felt to come together to overcome the challenges of the past few months. The Republic of China can be united. Taiwan can be safe. Being Taiwanese can be an honor that makes you hold your head high.My dear citizens, the path ahead of us is long, and we are about to begin a new chapter in Taiwan's story. Taiwan's story belongs to each and every one of us, and it needs each and every one of us.I ask that the 23 million people of Taiwan act as our guides and partners. Let us pool our wisdom and courage and make this country a better place together. Thank you.（For the full text in Mandarin: 最特別的就職典禮 蔡總統：感謝台灣人民【演說全文】）",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005200003

5/22/2020,A new 'internet for everything' era on the way: expert,"By Kay Liu, CNA staff writerThe global COVID-19 pandemic has upended people's lives, giving terms such as stay at home, work from home, and social distancing added resonance and accentuating the importance of the internet in connecting with others and doing one's job.What many are wondering is if these lifestyle changes will become entrenched and workplaces permanently altered even as the pandemic eases and people can move freely again.Kenny Huang, the chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), says the trends are here to stay, and he foresees a world of ""internet for everything,"" in which even more tasks will be done online.""Before the pandemic, the internet was an information technology tool. For businesses, it was used to help with operations, marketing or other areas. But in the post-COVID-19 era, all business activities will likely be connected to the internet,"" Huang said in a recent interview with CNA.Huang is in as good a position as anybody to look into the future of cyberspace.His TWNIC, which manages domain names ending with .tw and internet protocol (IP) addresses in Taiwan, routinely conducts surveys and issues reports on internet use that offer insights into trends and developments in the online world and help businesses make decisions.He believes COVID-19 has already made the internet part of a new reality because people no longer feel that things have to be done face-to-face, at least judging by the surge in online traffic and bandwidth he has observed from Dec. 30, 2019 to March 23.Huang estimates that the internet is used in about 10 percent of everyday work at present, but he expects that to go much higher in the future as habits change.Possible risksThe increasingly internet-dependent world that Huang envisions could have a downside, however, with risks that already exist such as threats to cybersecurity or the monopolization of information potentially magnified, he said.He pointed to the possibility of a wider spread of disinformation if people become more reliant on digital media as a news source.""There are always new solutions, but there will always be new types of disruptions,"" said Huang, who used the example of fake news evolving from pure fiction to mixing in some facts to create misinformation.The new solutions, he said, are the likes of the review mechanism introduced by Facebook and Twitter and the work of organizations such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center.Social mediaSocial media could also fall prey to the growing importance of the internet, Huang suggested.At its core, the internet is about transmitting data and connecting devices, while social media plays the role of ""connecting people, who share and exchange the knowledge and views they have,"" he said.Interactions online may mirror those in the real world, but they are not perfect reflections, he said.They could become even more imperfect as reliance on the internet means users gravitate to only a few major service providers, and those platforms' user agreement and rules become, in effect, the rules of society, Huang cautioned.According to the center's annual Taiwan Internet Report for 2019, 79.2 percent of those surveyed between September and November last year used online social media, of whom 98.9 percent used Facebook, 38.8 percent used Instagram and only 5.6 percent used Twitter.Security concernsBehind the changing of habits seen during the global pandemic, the introduction of fifth generation wireless technology (5G) could also profoundly affect user habits by offering accessible, fast internet access at an affordable price.But its arrival has posed a challenge to Taiwan's government that may dominate the debate over cyberspace in the post-COVID-19 world -- balancing an open ecosystem with security concerns.In terms of 5G, the existing internet environment could make it easy for just a few companies to become dominant players, and they may be foreign and even hostile to Taiwan's interests. That has led Taiwan's government to intervene in the 5G arena by banning the use of essential equipment from certain suppliers or countries, especially China, on the grounds of national security, Huang said.Such fears have extended into other areas, including to internet services, he said, citing the example of China-based video-conferencing service Zoom, which has soared in popularity during the pandemic but was banned in Taiwan for government and school use over security concerns.Yet the government has not been as interventionist in other social or commercial domains, Huang said, citing the example of the growing popularity of foreign online streaming services that are full of content from China.The TWNIC report found that 84.5 percent of those surveyed watched online video or streamed content, 76.3 percent of which was produced in Taiwan, followed by China (42.2 percent), the United States (38.2 percent), Japan (35.2 percent), South Korea (34.4 percent) and Europe (13.2 percent).Striking a balance between free speech and China's attempts to use cultural power to spread its message in Taiwan will not be easy for the government, Huang said.Personal protectionMeanwhile, Huang warned that we all, at some level, will have to be prepared for the pitfalls of being heavily reliant on the online world.Shutdowns of service ""have happened and could still happen, and the impact on us will only increase because the time we spend and our reliance on internet services is growing,"" he said.""When using online services, people need to think ahead and have a plan B in case a company shuts down operations. Everyone should back up data routinely, update online accounts, update passwords, and not allow cookies when browsing online when they are not necessary,"" he advised.Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005220009

5/22/2020,Global support for Taiwan at record high: former U.S. official,"Washington, May 21 (CNA) Randall G. Schriver, a former United States assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said Thursday that Taiwan has won huge global support because of its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, despite China's suppression.""Taiwan's international recognition, international admiration for Taiwan, international support for Taiwan has almost never been higher, because we see the juxtaposition of how the PRC has handled the coronavirus and how Taiwan has,"" Schriver said at a virtual conference hosted by the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.Schriver also berated China for poaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies and seeking to exclude Taiwan from global bodies like the World Health Organization.The Communist Party of China's ""approach to Taiwan has failed, not by my measure but by their own measure,"" he said in the forum, titled U.S.-Taiwan Relations and Taiwan's Evolving Role in the Global Order.As a result of China's failed policies, it has destroyed any pathway for what it calls peaceful reunification and any remaining constituency for a future ""one China,"" Schriver said.China's proposed 'one country, two systems' unification framework ""never had much of a constituency in Taiwan, but polls now regarding what aspirations people have for a future arrangement ... have never been worse from China's perspective,"" he said. ""So it is very difficult to see re-sinification of Taiwan through peaceful means.""In light of that situation, Schriver said, the U.S. should be concerned about a growing temptation on the part of China to use more military tools and coercion against Taiwan.Under such circumstances, the U.S. and Taiwan should strengthen cooperation in the field of information sharing, he said, adding that he supports U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to help boost its defense capability.Also at the forum, Evan Medeiros, Penner Family chair in Asian studies and the Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations, said it is becoming more difficult for the U.S. to strike a balance in supporting Taiwan while seeking to build a constructive relationship with China, given that China is growing more confident in East Asia, and Taiwan is facing increasing pressure and coercion from Beijing.Medeiros said the U.S. should take its security pledge to Taiwan seriously, sell Taiwan more weapons based on the Taiwan Relations Act, and help Taiwan join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Chin-yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005220011

5/22/2020,"Torrential rains to ease Saturday, but threat remains: CWB","Taipei, May 22 (CNA) The torrential rainfall that drenched Taiwan on Friday could ease up on Saturday, but heavy rainfall could still affect the central and southern parts of the country, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) warned.Taiwan is likely to see less rainfall over the weekend as the plum rain front that brought the deluge moves south toward the Bashi Channel and southeasterly winds weaken, forecasters said.According to the CWB, northern Taiwan and low-lying areas in central Taiwan should see milder weather, though they could still get heavy rain, defined by the CWB as more than 80 millimeters of rainfall over a 24 hour-period or 40 mm of rainfall in one hour.Mountainous areas in central Taiwan and low-lying areas in southern Taiwan could see extremely heavy rain, which the CWB defines as more than 200 mm of rainfall over a 24 hour-period or over 100 mm in three hours.In the south, mountainous areas in Chiayi County and some low-lying areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung could even see torrential rain, equal to more than 350 millimeters of rainfall over a 24-hour period, the bureau said.In mountainous areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, ""extreme torrential rain"" of more than 500 mm of rainfall could fall over a 24-hour period, the bureau forecast.Meanwhile, lightning, strong gusts, rock falls, mudslides and flooding are likely islandwide, according to the CWB.On Friday, some schools and offices were closed, and flooding and traffic disruptions were reported around Taiwan due to the inclement weather.Parts of Kaohsiung and Pingtung, where water levels were calf-deep, saw the most severe flooding in Taiwan.The heaviest rainfall was recorded in Sandimen Township in Pingtung, with 550 mm of precipitation accumulated between midnight and 6 p.m. Friday.In northern Taiwan's Hsinchu, rock falls blocked railroad tracks at around noon, causing delays for 1,400 passengers on 10 Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) trains.Several roads, including sections of the Southern Cross-Island Highway in the south, were also closed as a precautionary measure, transportation authorities said.According to the Education Ministry, 26 schools across Taiwan, most of which were in Tainan and Kaohsiung, have reported damage of up to NT$1.59 million (US$53,200) due to the torrential rains.(By Wang Shu-fen, Chen Chao-fu, Chen Chi-chung and Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005220018
5/22/2020,Few mentions of Taiwan in annual speech by Chinese premier: scholars,"Taipei, May 22 (CNA) Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克強) made scant mention of Taiwan in an important annual speech Friday, reflecting China's focus on its economy as it juggles a trade war with the United States and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, according to scholars of cross-strait relations.On Friday morning, Li delivered the government's work report -- a speech often compared to the U.S. state of the union address -- at the opening of China's annual parliamentary meeting, the National People's Congress.The 14,000 word speech was shorter than in previous years, which have averaged around 20,000 words, and also notable in that its references to Taiwan were limited to about 100 words.Tung Li-wen (董立文), an advisory board member at Taiwan Thinktank, told CNA Friday that the relatively minor references to Taiwan in the speech show that China currently has its hands full managing the economic impact of its trade war with the U.S. and the COVID-19 pandemic.As relates to Taiwan, Tung noted that last week China unveiled 11 incentives targeting Taiwanese businesses operating in China, showing that the country needs to retain Taiwanese talent and technology amid the tough economic climate.Chang Yu-shao (張宇韶), deputy secretary of the Cross-Strait Policy Association, characterized the language on Taiwan in the speech as ""soft in tone, but not without its jagged edges.""Li did not invoke political concepts such as ""one country, two systems"" or the ""1992 consensus"" in reference to Taiwan, and instead relied on broader appeals to Chinese nationhood, Chang said.At the same time, the speech omitted the word ""peaceful"" in its reference to ""national reunification,"" he said.The speech's more hardline content came in the announcement of new national security legislation for Hong Kong, though this also contained a sort of implicit threat to Taiwan, Chang said.Meanwhile, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded to Li's speech Friday with language from President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) recent inaugural address.In a statement, the MAC rejected China's ""one country, two systems"" model for ""downgrading Taiwan and undermining the cross-strait status quo.""Instead, it urged Beijing to accept Tsai's principles of ""peace, parity, democracy and dialogue"" as the foundation for cross-strait interaction.(By Lai Yen-hsi and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005220019

3/4/2020,TSMC teams up with Broadcom in 5nm process development,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has joined forces with U.S.-based integrated circuit designer Broadcom Inc. in advanced 5 nanometer process development.In a statement released Tuesday, TSMC said it has teamed up with Broadcom to strengthen the Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) integrated circuit packaging platform that supports 5nm technology.According to TSMC, CoWoS provides best-in-breed performance and highest integration density for high performance computing applications, and the particular wafer level system integration platform offers a wide range of interposer sizes, a number of high bandwidth memory (HBM) cubes, and package sizes.The cooperation with Broadcom means TSMC will provide one-stop services from IC packaging to pure wafer foundry services to Broadcom, which has come on board with other foreign tech giants such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Huawei Technolgies Inc., to use the Taiwanese chipmaker's 5nm process technology.In addition to contract chip production, TSMC has started high-end IC packaging operations in a bid to provide its customers with a wide range of comprehensive services.The 7 nanometer process is the latest technology the chipmaker has begun mass producing, while the company is also developing the more sophisticated 5mn and 3mn processes.TSMC is scheduled to launch mass production of the 5nm process in the first half of this year. The 3nm process is expected to begin commercial production in 2022.Through its partnership with Broadcom, TSMC's next generation CoWoS packaging services provide bandwidth of up to 2.7 terabytes per second, which is 2.7 times faster than the CoWoS solution the chipmaker previously offered in 2016.TSMC said with higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the CoWoS solution jointly developed with Broadcom is well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as deep learning, workloads for 5G networking and power-efficient data centers.At an investor conference held in mid-January, TSMC said the company expects to benefit from solid demand for smartphones, high performance computer (HPC) devices, Internet of Things related applications and automotive electronics this year.Amid optimism over global demand, TSMC has devoted itself to high-end technology development, a move expected to boost its global competitive edge and sustain the company's lead over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., which has started advanced technology processes with an eye to gaining a larger share of the global market.For the development of its high-end processes, TSMC has said capital expenditure for 2020 is expected to range from US$15-16 billion, the highest level in the company's history.Currently, TSMC has more than 50 percent of the global pure wafer foundry market.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003040004

The Dow plunged 3.58 percent Thursday.""Market sentiment here was moved by a soaring VIX on the U.S. markets as investors at home and abroad feared the COVID-19 spread in the U.S., the largest economy in the world, will further affect the global economy.""The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX), which is widely considered an ideal gauge of fear in the market, soared about 14 percent overnight.The spread of the COVID-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has undermined production in China and interrupted global supply chains. The contagion could also hurt private consumption in the U.S.Since the novel coronavirus first emerged at the end of December, more than 96,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with infections in more than 80 countries and territories and more than 3,300 deaths, the majority of which have been in China.""Such unfavorable circumstances are expected to pose threats to Taiwan's export-oriented economy,"" Su said.It was no surprise that Friday's selling in Taiwan focused on the bellwether electronics sector, which depends heavily on global demand, Su said.As of 10:58 a.m., TSMC had lost 2.01 percent to NT$316.50 with 25.07 million shares changing hands after its American depositary receipts (ADRs) lost 2.37 percent on U.S. markets overnight.Led by TSMC, the electronics sector was down 1.43 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index was down 1.76 percent.Also in the high tech sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had lost 1.93 percent to NT$81.10, while Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., was little changed at NT$4,600.00.Following a 1.45 percent fall in its ADRs overnight, integrated circuit packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. had lost 2.99 percent to NT$71.40, while IC designer MediaTek Inc. had lost 1.17 percent to NT$380.50.Selling was also seen among large cap old economy stocks with Formosa Plastics Corp. down 1.61 percent at NT$91.80 and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 2.15 percent at NT$68.20.In the financial sector, Fubon Financial Holding Co. had fallen 1.88 percent to NT$44.30, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. had lost 1.37 percent to NT$39.60.""The silver lining was that the magnitude of the fall in the local market was not as heavy as elsewhere in the world as the TWSE remained awash in liquidity and many investors appeared willing to park their money here,"" Su said.""I expect the Taiex will see strong support at around the 240-day moving average of 11,049 points,"" Su said.

3/13/2020,Stabilization fund ready to shore up equity market: MOF,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Finance Minister Su Jain-rong (蘇建榮) on Friday said the National Financial Stabilization Fund is ready to lend support to the local equity market and its committee could meet at anytime if necessary, amid global volatility spurred by escalating fears over the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 worldwide.At a news conference held at around 8:15 a.m., 45 minutes before the local equity market opened, Su urged investors to remain confident in Taiwan's economic fundamentals, saying the Ministry of Finance, the central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission will come up with measures to stabilize the stock market.Su made the comments as concerns over the spread of COVID-19 intensfied, sending ripples through global financial markets.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,352 points or almost 10 percent, the largest single session drop since Oct. 19, 1987, when the index shed 22.6 percent amid a global financial crisis, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index also dropped more than 9 percent even though the U.S. Federal Reserve took the unusual step of injecting funds into the market.Despite Su's remarks, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taiex still opened down 331.29 points at 10,091.03 and the weakness continued on panic-led selling across the board.Su said the stabilization fund is watching the local equity market closely and its committee could meet anytime, if necessary, and jump into the market to counter the impact of global volatility.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.The fund intervenes in the market when it receives authorization from the fund committee, which is currently managed by Vice Finance Minister Juan Ching-hwa (阮清華), who is executive secretary of the fund.However, Su said with the virus, originally from the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading worldwide, it is no surprise that the global economy faces severe challenges with plunging equity markets around the world.In addition to the dive on the U.S. markets, the equity markets in France, Germany and the United Kingdom also tumbled 12.28 percent, 12.24 percent and 10.87 percent, respectively, Thursday.Compared with the markets in the U.S. and Europe, Juan said, Taiwanese equities appear resilient despite the ongoing scare over the virus. He cited data from Feb. 24 to March 12, showing that the Taiex fell 10.82 percent, while the Dow dropped 26.88 percent, and the markets in France, Germany and the U.K. shed 32.93 percent, 32.54 percent and 29.26 percent, respectively.The relatively small drop in Taiwan came as the country has executed efficient and effective measures to contain the spread of the virus, Juan said, adding that healthy economic fundamentals and attractive dividend yields in the equity market have enabled Taiwanese stocks to fend off unfavorable external factors to some extent.""It is unnecessary for investors to panic,"" Juan said, ""They should have faith in the local equity market.""(By Wu Chia-jung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003130003

3/24/2020,Taiwan shares bounce back by over 5%,"Taipei, March 24 (CNA) Taiwan shares staged a strong rebound Tuesday morning after slumping a day earlier on gains posted by U.S. market futures, pointing to potential gains in U.S. markets Tuesday, dealers said.Market sentiment was boosted by the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement overnight of an unlimited bond purchase program to keep the world's largest economy from plunging into a recession, dealers said.As of 10:18 a.m., the benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), the Taiex, had risen 488.06 points, or 5.49 percent, to 9,378.09 on turnover of NT$74.47 billion (US$2.46 billion).After falling 3.73 percent a day earlier, the market opened up 2.18 percent and maintained its upward momentum, buoyed by gains in other regional markets, including in Seoul and Tokyo.Regional markets were encouraged by a rise in Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, which were up 4.8 percent at one point, dealers said.""The current buying helped the Taiex return to its 10-year moving average of about 9,100 points, a good sign technically for the market,"" Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su said.""I think government-led funds and even the National Stabilization Fund are among the bargain hunters, taking advantage of the improved investor mood to add ammunition to the Taiex,"" Su said, referring to the Fed's quantitative easing plan and also a potential fiscal stimulus bill to be passed by the U.S. Senate.Taiwan has also taken measures to prop up its market, including the activation of a NT$500 billion stabilization fund and a ban on shorting any stocks that end down more than 3.5 percent in the previous trading session, Su said.""The measures are working to stabilize the market,"" Su said.Among the rebounding tech heavyweights, chipmaker TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, had risen 6.47 percent to NT$271.50 as of 10:18 a.m.Led by TSMC, the electronics sector and the semiconductor sub-index were up 5.95 percent and 6.64 percent, respectively.Also in the electronics sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had gained 4.30 percent to NT$70.40, and Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., had added 8.41 percent to NT$3,740.00.Integrated circuit designer MeidaTek Inc. was up 8.93 percent at NT$335.50 due to a share buyback program that started from Monday and will run through May 22.""The local market has stopped heading south, and the next step is for it to consolidate, paving the path for an upswing. But how it will go depends on the performance of global markets,"" Su said.""In addition to the COVID-19 spread, investors should pay close attention to the global energy market. If international crude oil prices continue to fall, global stocks are expected to get hurt,"" Su said.In the petrochemical sector, which is highly correlated to crude oil prices, Nan Ya Plastics Corp. had risen 7.71 percent to NT$52.40 as of 10:18 a.m., Formosa Petrochemical Corp. had added 7.67 percent to NT$77.20, Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. had risen 6.29 percent to NT$65.90, and Formosa Plastics Corp. had gained 6.00 percent to NT$70.70.(By Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003240002

3/28/2020,U.S. reportedly eyes curb of TSMC's supply to Huawei,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) The United States has been aiming to curb the supply of chips sold by contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to China's Huawei Technologies Co. through planned heavier sanctions against the Chinese telecom equipment giant, according to a Reuters report.The report said while tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating with both sides blaming each other for spreading the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Trump administration has a plan to introduce new measures to further restrict global chip sales to Huawei.Under the proposed new rules, the report, dated Thursday in Washington, said foreign companies that use U.S. production equipment to roll out their chips would be required to obtain a U.S. license ahead of sales of certain chips to Huawei, which was blacklisted last year.Citing unnamed sources, the report said the measures are aimed at curbing supplies of chips to Huawei's integrated circuit design subsidiary arm HiSilicon Technologies Co. from TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.The report said it remained unknown whether President Donald Trump will approve the new sanction measures since he appeared to oppose the measures in February. If the new measures are imposed, Huawei and TSMC, as well as American enterprises, will feel the pinch, it said.The report quoted a research paper written by China-based Everbright Securities last year as saying most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials.""This is going to have a far more negative impact on U.S. companies than it will on Huawei, because Huawei will develop their own supply chain,"" trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said in the report. ""Ultimately, Huawei will find alternatives.""In Taipei, TSMC said it was unable to respond to any ""hypothetical questions"" and would not comment on any individual clients.According to a market estimate, Huawei accounts for about 10 percent of TSMC's total sales. Market analysts said if the strict rules are imposed, TSMC will see its shipments squeezed.After the possible heavier sanctions against Huawei surfaced, shares of TSMC gave up earlier gains of 2.14 percent on the Friday trading session in Taipei, falling 2.50 percent to close at NT$273.00 (US$9.03) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index also came off an earlier high of 9,954.86 points, down 0.38 percent to end at 9,698.92.On Friday, foreign institutional investors sold a net 5.23 million TSMC shares, stopping a three-day streak of a net buy, but for the entire week, such investors recorded a net buy of 28.47 million TSMC shares.TSMC's American depositary receipts on the U.S. market also fell 5.94 percent overnight as the market came under pressure amid fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.(By Emmanuelle Tseng, Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003280003

3/31/2020,All 214 evacuees from Hubei placed in quarantine,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The 214 Taiwanese nationals who returned to Taiwan on Monday night after being stranded in Hubei province by the new coronavirus outbreak have been placed in quarantine and will soon be tested for COVID-19.The passengers were taken by about a dozen tour buses to an undisclosed quarantine venue in northern Taiwan at around 1 a.m. Tuesday after undergoing health screenings at the airport, and will be quarantined for 14 days.Military servicemen chemically disinfected the vehicles after the passengers reached the quarantine facility.All returnees will be tested for COVID-19 within 48 hours, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center.The handling of these Taiwanese who were stuck in Hubei province after it went into lockdown in late January to contain the spread of the new coronavirus has been controversial.They were all put on a list of people who required special permission to return to Taiwan, unlike other Taiwanese currently returning from areas where the virus seems much more active, such as the United States and Europe.Those on the list are being required to return on special pre-arranged flights, which the government is describing as ""charter-like flights,"" and then put in quarantine in government-run facilities after arriving home.People arriving from other parts of China or other parts of the world can take regularly scheduled commercial flights to Taiwan and self-quarantine at home for 14 days.The 214 Taiwanese had to make their way on their own from Hubei province to Shanghai's Pudong International Airport to catch the special flight operated by China Airlines, which departed at 8:02 p.m. Monday and arrived at Taoyuan International Airport at 9:38 p.m.It was the second of two special flights contracted by the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a semi-official agency that handles cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in the absence of formal bilateral ties, to bring home Taiwan citizens stuck in Hubei.The first was arranged late Sunday, when 153 Taiwanese returned home.These Taiwanese had been stranded in Hubei since late January but were able to leave the area after restrictions on the movement of people there were lifted on March 25.Many others are still stuck in Wuhan, but will be able to leave if restrictions there are lifted on April 8 as scheduled.(By Liu Chien Pang and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310002

However, it was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.It has not been a member of the United Nations or the WHO since then.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310005
3/31/2020,Hon Hai shares edge higher on 2019 results,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker that churns out many of Apple's iPhones, moved higher Tuesday morning after it reported an increase in earnings per share (EPS) for 2019, dealers said.The gains were limited, however, as investors were wary of a fall in Hon Hai's profit margins amid escalating competition in the global market and concerns over a possible delay in the launch of the next generation iPhones amid the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.As of 11:38 a.m., shares of Hon Hai had gained 0.29 percent to NT$70.20 (US$2.32), off a high of NT$70.50, on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index was up 1.13 percent at 9,738.67 following gains in the U.S. overnight.In a statement released Monday, Hon Hai said it posted net profit of NT$115.31 billion in 2019, down 10.65 percent from a year earlier, but its EPS of NT$8.32 beat its EPS of NT$8.03 in 2018.Analysts said the EPS growth largely resulted from Hon Hai's move to cut its capitalization by about 20 percent in 2018 to NT$138.63 billion to maintain its EPS above the NT$8 level.It was the first time the company had lowered its capital since it first listed publicly in June 1991.Though EPS rose in 2019, the company's lower gross margin and operating profit margin fell due to intensifying global competition, giving investors pause.The company had a gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- of 5.91 percent in 2019, down 0.36 percentage points from a year earlier, and its net margin -- the difference between its gross profit and its total expenses -- was down 0.29 percentage points to 2.15 percent in 2019.Its operating profit margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- was also down 0.42 percentage points to 2.15 percent.In addition to cutting its paid-in capital, Hon Hai was also able to maintain its EPS above NT$8 in 2019 because of efforts to automate its production, a fall in the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, and a sharp decline in the losses of subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd.The Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, in which Hon Hai holds a 62.8 percent stake, cut its net loss to US$12.29 million in 2019 from US$857.12 million a year earlier because of efforts to keep costs down.Hon Hai had consolidated sales of NT$5.34 trillion in 2019, the highest in the company's history, but they were only up 0.92 percent from a year earlier.Hon Hai said it has scheduled an annual general meeting for June 23.Analysts have estimated that Hon Hai's sales in the first quarter of 2020 will fall 40 percent from NT$1.74 trillion in the fourth quarter to below NT$1 trillion because of slow season effects and falling demand caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.(By Chung Jung-feng and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310006

3/31/2020,Migrant factory employees call for dorms to be moved offsite,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A coalition of migrant rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations staged a rally in Taipei on Tuesday, calling for factory dormitories to be relocated away from the work site in the interest of safety.The approximately 50 people, gathered outside the Ministry of Labor (MOL), cited three incidents in recent years, in which 11 migrant workers and six firefighters died in blazes that broke out at factories that had dorms on the premises.In the most recent incident, three Vietnamese workers, who were housed in a dorm on the second floor of a metal manufacturing plant in Taichung, died when the factory went up in flames on March 22.""The root of the problem is that when those factories caught fire, it also burned down the dormitories because they were part of the factory,"" said Hsu Wei-tung (許惟棟) of the migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT). ""So, we are here today calling for the MOL to mandate that dormitories be located away from the workplace to save the lives of migrant workers and firefighters.""Prior to the Taoyuan fire earlier this month, six Vietnamese migrant workers in Taoyuan City died in December 2017 in a factory fire that engulfed their dormitory, which was on the upper level of a factory warehouse made of sheet iron. The structure belonged to Sican Co., which runs a factory that produces solar control window film.Four months later, a blaze at a facility operated by Chin Poon, a printed circuit board factory in Taoyuan, claimed the lives of two Thai workers who were trapped in a dormitory on the factory premises, while six firefighters died in the rescue efforts.""The firefighters rushed into the burning factory because it was their duty to save lives,"" Chu Chih-yu (朱智宇), secretary general of the National Association for Firefighters' Rights, said at Tuesday's rally. ""But if people didn't live inside the factory, then the firefighters would not have had to put their lives on the line and enter the burning building.""The migrant workers at the rally, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, along with Taiwanese supporters, shouted slogans and burned incense at a makeshift altar in memory of those who had perished in the factory fires.A Filipino, who asked to be identified only as Arturo, said when he was working at a factory in Taoyuan last year, he was housed in a dorm in the basement of the building with nine coworkers.""There was once an earthquake and we felt extremely scared because there was only one exit from the basement. Imagine a fire -- we all would have been trapped,"" said Arturo, whose right hand was severed in a factory accident last year.Another Philippine worker said, however, that work safety is not the sole responsibility of the employer, and there is no guarantee that factory employees will be safe even if their dorms are offsite.""I have seen workers cooking in their rooms when they are not supposed to, plugging as many as 10 power adaptors to one outlet in the wall, and bringing cellphones into the work area,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named.Common sense is what is most important when it comes to safety, she said, adding that she works with toxic, flammable and combustible materials on a daily basis.In response to the protesters' calls, Huang Wei-cheng (黃偉誠), a section chief at the MOL's Workforce Development Agency, said the ministry is planning to amend the law to make it mandatory for factories that have onsite dorms to file safety reports, which would include a declaration of any pyrophoric substances or flammable gases on the site.The legislation, which is expected to be completed by June, will also state how often safety checks will be carried out at factories, according to a statement issued later by the MOL.Hsu, however, expressed skepticism about such safety checks, saying that there are some 100,000 dormitories throughout Taiwan for migrant workers, while the number of inspectors responsible for checking on the welfare of the workers totals only 274.""Work safety and the general welfare checks are usually carried out once, when a migrant worker first arrives in Taiwan, due to a lack of manpower,"" Hsu said.Among the 719,847 migrant workers in Taiwan, 455,934 are employed in the industrial sector, according to MOL statistics valid as of the end of February.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310011

3/31/2020,Transgender activists release 7 policy demands,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Activists marked Tuesday's International Transgender Day of Visibility by announcing seven policy demands based on what they called the largest-ever survey of Taiwan's transgender community.At a press conference, the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) announced the results of the survey, which was open to respondents who identify as transgender under the broad definition of the term -- those whose gender identities or expressions differ from what is typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.The survey, which was conducted online March 14-25, received 518 valid responses, which served as the basis for the seven policy proposals, the TAPCPR said.The alliance's first two demands were to end the practice of requiring sex reassignment surgery for people seeking to change the gender designation on their national identification cards, as well as allowing coverage of elective sex reassignment surgeries under Taiwan's National Health Insurance program.According to a 2013 report on Taiwan's implementation of human rights by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the former requirement could constitute a form of torture, the group said.These concerns were further borne out in survey results, the TAPCPR said, in which 30.42 percent of the respondents said they were unsure about the safety of such surgeries, 29.54 percent doubted their necessity and 52.3 percent considered them prohibitively expensive.In its third and fourth demands, meanwhile, the group called for acceptance of the transgender community's collective diversity and for reforms of Taiwan's gender designation policies based on consultations with the transgender community.As an example of this diversity, the group cited survey results showing that 52 percent of the respondents identified as either male or female, while 48 percent identified themselves as nonbinary, gender-fluid or agender.Given the complexity of gender identity revealed in the survey results, the government should abandon the poorly received ""third gender policy"" it proposed in 2017, and instead should adopt new guidelines based on consultations with the transgender community, the alliance said.Fifth, the alliance called for an abolition of legal distinctions between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages.Because Taiwan's marriage equality law was passed as a special act rather than a revision of the Civil Code, which governs opposite-sex marriage, the legal rights enjoyed by the two forms of marriage vary, with a disproportionate impact on transgender individuals, the group said.For example, if a person married under the Civil Code seeks to change their gender designation and have their marriage recognized under the marriage equality act, they lose the right to adopt children as a couple and can only adopt their partner's biological children as a step-parent, the group said.On a broader social level, the alliance recommended starting gender identity education beginning in elementary school as a way of pre-empting the experience of the 47.68 percent of survey respondents who said they were bullied, discriminated against or otherwise mistreated at school.Similarly, the government should include transgender people in its monitoring of hate crimes, given that 37.3 percent of those surveyed said they had suffered workplace discrimination, the alliance said.Overall, the survey respondents reported suffering a wide range of social difficulties related to their gender identification.These included 55.41 percent who feared discrimination in public restrooms, 24.32 percent who delayed or avoided medical treatment and 22.01 percent who had been discriminated against while shopping for clothes or accessories.Another 18.53 percent said they had been sexually harassed or attacked in public, while 15.83 percent were afraid to call the police in an emergency, according to the survey results.(By Yang Su-min and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310015
3/31/2020,Constitutional Court hears debate on decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Grand justices heard arguments at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday on whether a criminal law that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after several judges asked for an interpretation of the law.Article 239 of Taiwan's Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.Eighteen judges and a male who was convicted of adultery have asked the Constitutional Court in recent years to overturn Interpretation 554, which determined that Article 239 was constitutional.The most recent one was a judge surnamed Chen (陳) from the Miaoli District Court who mainly hears cases related to ""offenses against marriage,"" who felt Article 239 may violate the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan).The court finally agreed to hear the case and heard arguments Tuesday, some of which centered around Interpretation 554.The interpretation, which was made in 2002, ruled that the freedom of sexual behavior is inseparably related to the personality of individuals, and every person is free to decide whether or not and with whom to have sexual affairs.Such freedom is, however, legally protected only if it is not detrimental to the social order or public interest as provided in Article 22 of the Constitution, and therefore the freedom of sexual behavior is subject to the restriction put on it by marriage and the family system, the ruling said.One of the judges arguing for decriminalization, Wu Chih-chiang (吳志強), said adultery is not the only factor that shakes a marriage and therefore there was no need to intervene with ""national punishment.""He argued that Article 239 could lead to unfairness and inequality in administering punishment, forcing people to maintain an unwanted marriage.Wu was referring to complaints by supporters of the decriminalization of adultery that under Article 239 the crime of adultery cannot be prosecuted without a complaint by the victim, and if one spouse withdraws charges against the other, the withdrawal does not apply to the outside party.That has led in practice to women likely to be pressured by their husbands to drop the charges against them during the proceedings, yet the cases against the mistresses go ahead.Judge Chang Yuan-sen (張淵森) argued that the purpose of criminalizing adultery was to protect the family and social morals and prevent people from suffering in a miserable marriage.Yet while the law gives people the ability to get married and divorced freely, it cannot use criminal law to ""threaten"" people into acting faithfully in a marriage, he contended.Many factors cause suffering in a marriage, including the relationship between the wife and her mother-in-law, child education problems, financial issues, and sexual relations, Chang said.""If one person suffers in a marriage, it does not mean the other party has to be punished. Suffering should not be a reason for punishment in the Criminal Code,"" he said.Chi Hui-jung (紀惠容), a former executive director of the Garden of Hope Foundation who attended the Constitutional Court as a friend of the court to present her opinions, called Article 239 a law that punishes women.Although there are more men charged for adultery than women, in the end more women, most of them the mistresses in the cases, are convicted, she said.At the same time, she argued, the crime of adultery uses the Criminal Code to deter people from having affairs, but in a society that now frowns on using corporal punishment to discipline children, it is inappropriate to use ""threats"" to keep marriages together.Deputy Minister of Justice Tsai Pi-chung (蔡碧仲) argued, however, that the criminalization of adultery is aimed at safeguarding the marriage and family system.To support her position, Tsai cited Interpretation No. 544, which says the root of the nation's marital system lies in the freedom of personality, with such social functions as the maintenance of the order of human relationships and gender equality, and the raising of children.To insure an enduring and unimpaired system of marriage, the state may of course enact relevant rules to require a husband and wife to be mutually bound to each other by the duty of faithfulness, the interpretation says.The freedoms of individuals should still be restricted by the need to maintain social order, Tsai argued, and therefore Article 239 is not unconstitutional.(By Lin Chang-shun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310016
3/31/2020,Prosecutors voice support for decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310017

""MOFA will continue to work with the U.S. and other like-minded countries to advance our shared values and common goals and deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership on the global stage.""The TAIPEI Act was first introduced in the U.S. Senate by Cory Gardner last May, with Republican Congressman John Curtis unveiling a similar version in the House of Representatives in October, amid Beijing's continued efforts to squeeze Taiwan's international space.The legislation was passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier this month and later signed into law by Trump.The Act calls on the U.S. government to further Taiwan-U.S. bilateral trade and economic relations, help Taiwan participate in international organizations, and strengthen Taiwan's partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific region and in the world, according to Ou.It also authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider altering its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious actions to undermine Taiwan's security and prosperity, she said.The Republic of China (Taiwan), a founding member of the WHO, was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.International support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.Taiwan has been trying to rejoin the WHO since 1997. From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was able to participate in the WHA as an observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" with Beijing's approval, as cross-Taiwan Strait relations were warmer at the time.Since 2017, however, the year after President Tai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) took office, the Chinese government has been blocking Taiwan's efforts to participate in the WHA, due to differences between Taipei and Beijing over the so called ""1992 Consensus.""The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China,"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310022
3/31/2020,U.S. military aircraft fly near Taiwan for 4th time this month,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A United States military aircraft was reported flying near Taiwan's southern airspace Tuesday, marking the fourth time this month a U.S. warplane had been spotted operating near the country.The U.S. Navy P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft was operating in the South China Sea, according to a flight chart posted on Twitter on Tuesday by Aircraft Spots, a military air movement tracker.Asked to comment, Taiwanese military spokesman Shih Shun-wen (史順文) did not directly confirm the movement, saying only that the nation's armed forces are closely monitoring the country's surrounding waters and airspace.Based on charts released by Aircraft Spots and Taiwan's own records, the latest incident was the fourth time in March that a U.S. warplane was found to have been operating near the nation's airspace.The previously three occurrences all happened last week: on March 25 by an EP-3E ARIES II reconnaissance aircraft, on March 26 by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber and a KC-135 tanker, and on March 27 by another B-52 bomber and an RC-135U reconnaissance aircraft.Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS McCampbell conducted operations in the Taiwan Strait on March 25, according to information released by the U.S. Pacific Fleet on its Facebook page.The U.S. military's frequent operations around Taiwan, both in the air and at sea in the past week are designed to show that the U.S. is continuing its monitoring of the region, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, local military analysts told CNA.Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), a section chief of the government-funded thinktank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), said the U.S. warplanes intentionally turned on their transponders so that their signals could be picked up by air movement trackers.In this way, it was sending a clear message tactically that it is closely watching the region despite the pandemic.These military movements might also be monitoring any moves made by their Chinese counterparts, he added.Lin Ying-yu (林穎佑), an assistant professor at National Chung Cheng University's Institute of Strategic and International Affairs, said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is apparently playing the ""anti-China/pro-Taiwan"" card by frequently sending warplanes and warships near Taiwan in the hope of gaining more voter support in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310023
3/31/2020,FAT chairman released on NT$8 million bail,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Chang Kang-wei (張綱維), chairman of Far Eastern Air Transport Corp.

3/31/2020,Taiwan's COVID-19 response could reach NT$1 trillion: premier,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The Taiwan government's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could reach as much as NT$1 trillion (US$33 billion), Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) told a legislative hearing on Tuesday.Such a figure would more adequately reflect the global nature of the crisis than the NT$60 billion special budget the Executive Yuan proposed in February, when the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was mainly limited to China, Su said.In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee De-wei (李德維) asked Su to detail the timing and scale of response measures being planned by the government, inquiring whether it would seek anything on the scale of Singapore's recently announced S$48 billion (US$33.65 billion) stimulus plan.""The overall scale will likely be around NT$1 trillion,"" Su said, arguing that the size of various countries' response measures will vary based on a variety of factors.In the United States, for example, people use private, rather than public insurance, while Taiwan uses the National Health Insurance program. Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202003310025

4/12/2020,127 European parliamentarians support Taiwan's WHA bid,"Taipei, April 12 (CNA) In a series of letters, 127 European parliamentarians have expressed support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwan's foreign ministry said Saturday.One of the letters, dated April 8 and addressed to European Union High Representative Josep Borrell, was signed by 67 EU parliamentarians from six party caucuses, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said.""The WHO treatment of Taiwan as part of China has caused problems for Taiwan,"" according to a copy of the letter that was posted on Twitter by one of the signatories, former Poland Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga.Not only is Taiwan's democratically elected government barred from participation in the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), but Taiwanese experts are also arbitrarily prevented from attending the WHO's technical meetings, the letter stated.""In these difficult times, the substantial cooperation in areas such as medical supplies, research and development of vaccines between Taiwan, the EU and its Member States would be beneficial in order to curb the further spread of the pandemic and better prepare for any future outbreak,"" the letter reads.One of the other letters was signed by 60 legislators of the German Parliament on April 2 and addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been heavily criticized by the U.S. and several other countries for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to MOFA.Anita Schäfer, chairperson of the German-Chinese Association-Friends of Taiwan, wrote in that letter that the WHO's treatment of Taiwan was inconsistent with its organizational values, MOFA said.The foreign ministry expressed appreciation for the support of the 127 European parliamentarians, saying they were the ""voice of justice.""The empathy of those parliamentarians for Taiwan is in sharp contrast to Tedros' biased statements about Taiwan, MOFA said.Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist, should be impartial and professional on the matter of the Taiwanese people's health and welfare, MOFA said.Since Taiwan was expelled from the WHO in 1972, its participation in the WHA as an observer has been limited to an eight-year period, from 2009 to 2016, amid relatively warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations during that time.International support for Taiwan's bid to rejoin in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.(By Chen Yun-yu and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202004120001

He was 96.Chung's son Chung Yen-wei (鍾延威) told reporters that the family found Chung not breathing around 7 p.m. Saturday.Chung Yen-wei said despite his father's old age, he was in relative stable health over the years. The family is deeply saddened and shocked by Chung's sudden passing and is now preparing his funeral.Born in Taoyuan's Longtan district in 1925 during Japanese rule, Chung was widely considered the doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement,"" who was most famous for his works, ""The Dull Ice Flower (魯冰花),"" ""the Turbid Waters Trilogy"" (濁流三部曲) and ""the Taiwanese Trilogy"" (台灣人三部曲).His classics of Taiwanese literature depicts the lives and fates of Taiwanese against the background of post-World War II Taiwan, following the end of the Japanese colonial period.In mourning the passing of Chung, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) expressed condolence to his family and said the passing of the nonagenarian literati is a great loss to the nation's literary circle.In a Facebook post, Tsai also praised Chung, an ethnic Hakka, for playing an import role in promoting Hakka culture and Taiwanese literature.Chung and other writers of his time had jointly published a regular newsletter in the post WWII era, the Literary Bulletin -- a periodical that proved essential to young and aspiring writers of that time, according to Tsai.Tsai said she will always remember Chung as an elder who saw her as his own child. She pledged to bear Chung's teaching in mind to continue the promotion of Hakka and Taiwanese culture so that Chung's legacy will last for generations to come.Asked to comment on Chung's legacy, writer Chen Fang-ming (陳芳明) told CNA that Chung had a tremendous impact toward the development of Taiwanese literature.Chung had played an crucial rule during the transitional period in the 1950s after the Kuomintang (KMT) had just taken over the governing of Taiwan from Japan at the end of Japanese colonial rule, according to Chen.Sincere condolences on the passing of #Hakka literary master Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政). The esteemed writer passed away on May 16 at the age of 96. https://t.co/zUbiiwwuCE pic.twitter.com/PH02BDFO0WAt that time, most Taiwanese could only speak Japanese and very few people could speak Mandarin, let alone write in the Chinese language. Chung was one of a handful of native Taiwanese writers of that time that can.Aside from focusing on his own works, Chung also published the Literary Bulletin that offered a platform for Taiwanese writers to publish their works.Chung's works had faithfully recorded the everyday lives of Taiwanese people of his time which showed his deep connection and affection toward his homeland, Chen noted.The Hakka Affairs Council, meanwhile, remembered Chung as not only a prolific writer but a devoted promoter of Hakka affairs who helped promote the awareness of Hakka culture to a national level, which successfully led to the creation in the 1990s of a dedicated Hakka language radio station.(By Chiu Chun-chin, Su Lung-chi Chen Ping-hung, Wu Hsin-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005170003
5/17/2020,Fuel prices to rise for third straight week,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan's two major fuel suppliers announced price hikes Sunday for a third consecutive week as international crude oil prices continued to rebound in global markets.State-run oil refiner CPC Corp. Taiwan will raise its retail gasoline and diesel prices by NT$0.9 per liter, effective midnight Sunday, the company said.After the increase, prices at CPC gas stations will be NT$19.1 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$20.6 per liter for 95 unleaded, NT$22.6 per liter for 98 unleaded, and NT$16.3 per liter for super diesel, CPC said.The latest price hikes came after international oil prices rose this past week because of the gradual stabilization of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world and news that Saudi Arabia would further cut oil production in June.CPC adjusts its fuel prices weekly based on changes in crude oil prices, using a weighted oil price formula composed of 70 percent Dubai crude and 30 percent Brent crude.Based on that formula, the price of crude rose US$3.36 over the past week from US$24.87 per barrel to US$28.23 per barrel, the company said.Meanwhile, CPC's main competitor, Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC), announced identical price hikes Sunday, to take effect at 1 a.m. Monday.After the adjustments, prices at FPCC gas stations will be NT$19.1 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$20.5 per liter for 95 octane unleaded, NT$22.6 per liter for 98 octane unleaded, and NT$16.1 per liter for diesel.(By Pan Tzu-yu and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005170004
5/17/2020,No new COVID-19 cases in Taiwan for 10th straight day,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan confirmed no new cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus for the 10th consecutive day on Sunday, keeping the total at 440 since the pandemic began late last year, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).It was also the 35th straight day with no domestically transmitted infections, according to CECC statistics. The last time Taiwan recorded a domestic infection was on April 12.The lack of cases has led to a gradual loosening of restrictions that have been in place, and Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC, said at a daily briefing that special entertainment establishments could reopen under certain circumstances.The establishments, such as hostess KTVs and hostess dance clubs, would have to adopt social distancing guidelines, and customers and staff members would need to wear masks and have their temperatures checked and use hand sanitizer before entering the premise, Chen said.A system will also have to be in place that allows the businesses to reach customers after they have left, Chen said.""If the local governments can ensure these measures, then we can start re-opening these establishments,"" Chen said.Since the outbreak of COVID-19 late last year, Taiwan has recorded 440 cases, 349 of which have been classified as imported and 55 as local infections, according to CECC statistics.The other 36 cases are a cluster infection on a Navy vessel that returned April 9 from a Pacific goodwill mission. Those cases have not yet been classified as either local or imported, CECC data showed.To date, 395 COVID-19 patients in Taiwan have recovered, seven have died, with the remainder are still hospitalized, the CECC said in a statement.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 4,660,752 people in 187 countries and regions, including 1,489,642 in the United States, 272,043 in Russia, 240,161 in the United Kingdom, 230,698 in Spain and 224,760 in Italy, with a total of 311,064 fatalities, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.(By William Yen) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005170005
5/17/2020,Hostess club in Tainan reopens to customers amid COVID-19,"Tainan, May 17 (CNA) A hostess dance club in Tainan reopened Saturday, becoming the first such club in Taiwan's six major metropolitan areas to restart business after being shut down last month because of fears it could easily spread COVID-19.Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) said the city government issued a business resumption permit to the Wan Hsiang Dance Club (萬象舞廳) Friday after the club passed a government inspection.The 35-year-old Wan Hsiang Dance Club is so far the only legitimate hostess club among the five in the southern Taiwan city that has applied to reopen, according to Huang.City government officials said owners of the club pledged to implement the Central Epidemic Command Center's (CECC's) epidemic prevention guidelines against COVID-19 as it reopens its doors to customers.These guidelines include asking customers to follow social distancing measures, having them wear a face mask, taking their temperatures, and getting them to use hand sanitizer before entering the clubs.The club will also be required to control the flow of people by keeping a register of those entering, the city government said.The club's owners pledged to register the name and ID card numbers of each customer, and transparent plastic partitions have also been installed in each private booth to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Customers will also be forbidden to dance with a partner despite the resumption of operations, but will be allowed to dance alone, the club said, without elaborating.Huang said city officials will conduct inspections of the club to make sure it is following related guidelines, and the club will be closed for a week should violations be reported.Local media quoted the 75-year-old owner of the club surnamed Tseng (曾) as saying that the month-long suspension is the longest period of time the establishment has been closed during its 35-year history.The shutdown has seriously affected the livelihoods of the club's 100 employees and 200 hostesses, and they are all eager to see business resume, Tseng was cited as saying.The CECC on April 9 ordered hostess clubs across the country shut down, saying they posed a high risk of spreading COVID-19 after a hostess at a club in Taipei was confirmed to have the disease.As the number of cases dwindled to practically zero in the first week of May, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, announced on May 8 that local governments could decide whether to reopen their cities' hostess clubs under certain conditions.Tainan is the only one of Taiwan's six special municipalities -- which also include Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung -- to allow hostess bars to reopen so far.(By Chang Rong-hsiang and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005170006

5/17/2020,Taiwan advised to work with major economies after COVID-19,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan must seize the opportunity to work with major economies seeking to relocate global supply chains outside of China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic scholars suggested as President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) begins her second term on May 20.The pandemic, which has made many countries aware of their growing economic dependence on China for goods in several critical sectors, has led to calls to delink global supply chains of major industries from China.That trend offers an extremely good opportunity to Taiwan, said Ray Yang (楊瑞臨), consulting director of the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center (ISTI) under the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).He said the United States, China and Europe may all look to develop independent production capabilities in the post-COVID-19 world, and Taiwan has an opportunity to become an important partner for all of them.Yang said the U.S. will still be the world leader but cannot go it alone and will itself have to form partnerships with economies such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Taiwan is well positioned, Yang said, because the COVID-19 crisis has opened the world's eyes to the strengths of Taiwanese businesses, including their ability to respond quickly to different situations, high degree of flexibility and quality of manufactured goods.That was seen most clearly in Taiwan's ramping up of production of face masks and protective gear for medical workers to meet high demand during the coronavirus epidemic, he said.Meanwhile, Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, predicted that the U.S. economy would recover faster from the coronavirus pandemic than China.That trend has already prompted more Taiwanese businesses operating overseas to increase investment in Taiwan and reduce investment in China and other countries, Chiu said.Chiu also contended it will be in Taiwan's interests if the United States create an alliance of ""trusted partners"" to restructure supply chains away from China, as has been reported.According to a Reuters report in early May, the alliance would apply common standards for everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to trade, education and commerce, with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, India and Vietnam among potential partners.Though Taiwan is not on the list of ""trusted partners,"" it is a reasonable assumption that Taiwan has an opportunity to be included in the next phase given that Taiwan is considered a partner in the U.S.'s ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,"" Chiu said.""We must let the United States know that Taiwan can make its planned supply chains more complete,"" Chiu said, pointing to Taiwan's semiconductor industry's advantage in wafer fabrication and packaging and testing technology, which would help build the U.S.'s IC design capabilities.Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises' strength in producing spare parts and component production could also strengthen those new supply chains, Chiu said.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wu Po-wei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005170008

We hope today's event will bring the civil societies of the two countries closer,"" said TDDA Chairwoman Kuo Chia-yo (郭家佑), who began connecting with Norwegians in Taiwan three months ago.Other activities had been held in recent weeks to mark Norwegian National Day, including Norwegian cooking classes, a workshop on drawing a map of Norway, and a language-learning class, she said.Geir Yeh Fotland, a Norwegian born in Taiwan, told CNA that Norway's government has suspended all gatherings, including its National Day parade, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, making the Taipei event special.""I think this might be the only Norwegian National Day parade in the world, at least the longest with more than 60 people. So that's a great event,"" said Fotland, fondly called ""Norwegian grandpa"" by many Taiwanese who know him.Oslo is usually not keen on promoting Taiwan due to Beijing's influence in recent years, but major newspapers in Norway started to mention Taiwan in May because of its good performance in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, he said.""Taiwan has shown the world that we are independent from COVID-19 while the rest of the world is occupied by COVID-19, as Norway.""Oslo cut its official ties with Taipei in January 1950. Neither government has a liaison office on the other's soil after Oslo closed its trade office in Taipei in 2004 and Taipei closed its representative office in Norway in 2017.According to Fotland, there are about 10 Norwegian students and six to eight Norwegian nationals living in Taiwan, some of them retired and others here doing business.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005170009

5/17/2020,Rights group urges Taiwan to allow cross-national same-sex marriage,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) The Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) and several same-sex couples on Sunday urged Taiwan's government to allow same-sex marriages between couples from different countries.Taiwan's government legalized same-sex marriage in May 2019, becoming the first Asian country to do so.According to the Act Governing the Choice of Law in Civil Matters Involving Foreign Elements, however, a cross-national same-sex marriage can only be recognized in Taiwan if the countries of which the two partners are citizens both recognize same-sex marriage.The restriction discriminates against the LGBT community in Taiwan as marriage is a constitutional right, Pan Tien-ching (潘天慶), a lawyer from the TAPCPR, said at a press conference held near Taiwan's Presidential Office Building.Several cross-national same-sex couples lamented their difficult situations at the press conference.""For many cross-national same-sex couples, including me and my wife, our efforts to be with our loved ones are symbolized by our old plane ticket stubs,"" said Kaili Lai, a Taiwanese LGBT married to a Malaysian Tan Bee Guat.According to Lai, she and Tan held a simple wedding in Malaysia in 2016 with the blessings of their parents.Tan was not allowed to live in Taiwan, however because she was not a Taiwanese citizen and could not get a residence certificate because her marriage to Lai was not recognized.They had to fly frequently between Taiwan and Malaysia to see each other, leaving Tan little choice but to enroll in a university in Taiwan as a freshmen at the age of 35 to be able to stay in Taiwan on a student visa.But Tan is graduating next month and will have to enroll in a graduate school program to continue staying in Taiwan.Another cross-national same-sex couple, Joyce from Taiwan and Queenie from the Philippines, are facing the same predicament -- Queenie has to enroll in National Taiwan Normal University for the same purpose.According to the TAPCPR, the signature campaign it launched on May 9 to petition the government to amend laws that restrict same-sex marriage between such couples received 13,500 signatures and support from 20 human rights watchdogs in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Indonesia and the United States.The TAPCPR said it had written to relevant government units such as the Ministry of Justice, Mainland Affairs Council, National Immigration Agencies and the Ministry of Interiors on the issue.""Most government agencies have agreed that the issues need to be addressed but admitted that more coordination between relevant agencies is needed,"" the TAPCPR said as it urged President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to resolve the issue.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005170011

What makes it special is not its size or the number of people in attendance. It is special because we know how difficult it has been for us to get to this point.I want to thank the people of Taiwan for making such a difficult feat possible.I particularly want to thank a group of people who have not received a lot of attention over the past four months in our fight against COVID-19. I want to thank every single person who waited in line outside of the pharmacy in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for trusting the government. You have shown the world Taiwan's commitment to civic virtues, even in times of greatest distress.I also want to thank everyone who was quarantined or isolated at home, putting up with inconvenience in your daily life to keep others safe and healthy. Thank you for exemplifying humanity's best qualities and helping us successfully bring the coronavirus outbreak under control.This sense of pride in our country, this community's shared destiny, and the memories of these past months will live on in all of our hearts. This is what solidarity feels like.Many ambassadors and representatives from other countries are here today, and I trust that many countries around the world are watching Taiwan as well.I want to take this opportunity to tell you that the country you see is populated by kind and resilient people. No matter the difficulties we face, we can always count on our democracy, our solidarity, and our sense of responsibility towards each other to help us overcome challenges, weather difficult times, and stand steadfast in the world.From January to now, Taiwan has amazed the international community twice. The first was our democratic elections, and the second was our success in the fight against COVID-19.In recent months, Taiwan's name has appeared in headlines around the world, thanks to our successful containment of the coronavirus outbreak.""Taiwan"" is also emblazoned on the boxes of supplies we are sending abroad. The Taiwanese people have the kindest hearts in the entire world, and we will always offer help to the international community whenever we are able.I hope that in addition to sharing in a sense of pride and joy, my fellow citizens can take to heart the spirit of ""helping ourselves to help others;"" ""when we help ourselves, others will help us.""This pandemic has not yet ended, and we must remain vigilant. Even when it ends, its impacts will linger on.The coronavirus has profoundly affected our world. It has changed the global political and economic order, accelerated and expanded the reorganization of global supply chains, restructured the global economy, and changed the way we live and shop. It has even changed the way the international community views Taiwan and developments in the surrounding region.These changes present us with both challenges and opportunities. I want to ask that my fellow citizens be prepared, because countless challenges and difficulties remain ahead of us.Over the next four years, only those who can end the pandemic within their borders, lay out a strategy for their country's survival and development, and take advantage of opportunities in the complex world of tomorrow, will be able to set themselves apart on the international stage.It takes more than fervor to govern a country. Leadership means calmly taking the right direction in a changing world. That is precisely what I have done over the past four years.I said before that I will leave you with a better country. So over the next four years, I will proactively develop our industries, foster a safe society, ensure national security, and deepen our democracy. I am going to reinvent Taiwan and lead our country into the future.1. Industrial and Economic DevelopmentI know that the Taiwanese people are most concerned about our industrial and economic development. In 2016, we initiated a new economic development model to help connect Taiwan's economy to the world. Over the past four years, despite massive changes in the international economy, Taiwan has done more than just weather the storm. Our economic growth has once again topped the Four Asian Tigers, and the stock market index now regularly breaks 10,000 points.Thanks to our successful control of the pandemic, so far, Taiwan is able to maintain positive economic growth. This is rare in the world. However, we need to continue to take early action on economic relief and revitalization, and do whatever it takes to maintain stable economic growth.Over the next four years, we will face more intense changes in the global economy and the accelerated reorganization of supply chains. We will continue to implement our Forward-looking Infrastructure Development and trillion NT-dollar investment programs. We will do so in the spirit of ""achieving growth through stability, and seizing opportunity amid changes,"" in order to secure Taiwan's economic development over the coming decades.In terms of industrial development, we are going to take advantage of the opportunities before us in six core strategic industries founded on our 5+2 Innovative Industries Program, to transform Taiwan into a critical force in the global economy.First, we will continue to develop our information and digital industries. We will take advantage of Taiwan's strengths in the semiconductor and ICT industries to secure a central role in global supply chains, and make Taiwan a major base for the development of next generation technologies, including IoT and AI.Second, we are going to develop a cybersecurity industry that can integrate with 5G, digital transformation, and our national security. We will strive to create cybersecurity systems and an industrial chain that can protect our country and earn the world's trust.Third, we are going to create biotech and medical technology industries integrated with the rest of the world. Throughout this pandemic, Taiwanese teams have proven that they are capable of working with world-class technologies to produce reagents and develop new drugs and vaccines. We are going to give these industries our utmost support, and transform Taiwan into a key force in the global battle against infectious diseases.Fourth, we are going to develop national defense and strategic industries by integrating military and civilian capabilities. In addition to domestically-produced naval vessel and aircraft programs that are currently underway, we will push harder to promote technological integration between the military and the private sector, to stimulate private sector production capabilities, and advance into the aviation and space industries.Fifth, we are going to accelerate the development of green energy and renewable energy industries. Over the past four years, renewable energy has experienced explosive growth, and Taiwan has become a hotspot for international investment. Building on this foundation, I am confident that we will achieve our goal of deriving 20% of our overall energy from green sources by 2025. We are going to make Taiwan a center for green energy in Asia.Sixth, we are going to establish strategic stockpile industries that can ensure the steady provision of critical supplies. Facing changes to the global order, we need to keep key industrial chains in Taiwan and maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the production of face masks, medical and daily supplies, energy, and food.In the current international climate, countries that end their dependence on others will have a head start on national development. I would like our friends across all industries to rest assured that our government stands with you. Over the next few years, we have several strategies to drive the growth of our industries.First, we will use domestic demand, particularly demand from the public sector and national security needs, as the basic engine for our industrial development.A prime example of this is the way strategic demand for face masks and other medical supplies throughout this pandemic has spurred the development of related industries. We can adopt a similar model for our national defense and renewable energy industries to help accelerate their development.We will continue to organize ""national teams,"" like our face mask team, according to the size and conditions of different industries. We will utilize our government's guarantee of domestic demand to establish a global strategic materials manufacturing industry under the ""Taiwanese brand"" and help it expand into other markets.We know that financial support is crucial to industrial development. Looking to the future, we will adopt more flexible financial policies, continue to reform financial systems, and use more diverse means to help industries obtain the financing they need.We will also work to create a safe environment for our industries. Our government is committed to maintaining sound public health and national security systems, a stable society, strong rule of law, and a healthy market. We need to offer these guarantees so that high-tech and strategic industries will be willing to choose Taiwan as their production and R&D base.We will also continue to guide the global expansion of our industries. We will keep working to sign trade or investment protection agreements with the United States, Japan, and European countries.As we continue to promote our New Southbound Policy, we will also develop other potential markets and encourage firms to establish operations there, giving our industries an edge when they engage in international cooperation. Overseas Taiwanese business communities around the world will be our best partners as we seek new international opportunities.Finally, we have the issue of talent. In order for Taiwan to become a key global economic force, we need a diverse talent pool. My government will bring in the world's top technical, R&D, and management talents to help globalize Taiwan's workforce, widen our industries' horizons, and give them the ability to compete in the international arena.Looking to the future, Taiwan must further connect with the international community. We will work to cultivate more outstanding bilingual and digital talents, giving our industries a global competitive edge.Over the next four years, Taiwan's economy will enter a new stage, complete with more flexible capital and talent flows, more robust industrial capabilities, and closer ties with the world. Together, we are going to enter a new era of shared prosperity.2. Safe Society: Health and Social Safety Nets to Catch Those Who Need HelpAs we develop our industries, we will also keep in mind that the people expect the government to foster a safe society. To be a better country, the government must take on more responsibilities to reduce the burden on the people and mitigate issues in society.Over the past few years, we have addressed Long-term Care 2.0, childcare, and residential justice issues. Over the next four years, my goal is to weave an even tighter net that can catch every single person who needs help and prevent future tragedies.●Health and Disease Prevention Safety NetFirst, we will strengthen our health and disease prevention safety net. Taiwan is an ageing society, and infectious diseases pose a serious challenge to the health of our people. That is why we need to bolster our disease prevention and treatment capabilities and link industries to make more breakthroughs in vaccine and new drug development, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, so that people can enjoy healthy lives and receive better care.●Mending Gaps in the Social Safety NetOur second step will be to mend the gaps in our social safety net. Over the past few years, a great deal of discussion has arisen around public safety incidents involving schizophrenia patients. The same goes for other mental illnesses, drug addiction, and domestic violence.I understand your concerns. These issues are not just the responsibility of individuals or families, they are the responsibility of the government. When families are unable to provide proper care, the government has a duty to step in and help.I am going to upgrade our social care system, enhance the capabilities of frontline social workers, and improve their work environments, so that they can work at the grassroots and identify people who have fallen through the gaps in our safety net.We cannot hold medical agencies or individual judges solely responsible for controversies surrounding specific cases. Our judicial and executive branches should reevaluate and optimize these systems and take initiatives to make any necessary legal amendments.3. National Security: National Defense Reforms, Active International Participation, Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsA better country requires a greater emphasis on national security. Over the past four years, we have pushed for national defense reforms, active international participation, and peaceful, stable cross-strait relations. We hope that Taiwan can play a more active role in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Over the next four years, the direction of our policies will remain the same, and we will do even more.●National Defense ReformsWe have three important directions for our national defense reforms. First is accelerating the development of our asymmetrical capabilities. While we work to bolster our defense capabilities, future combat capacity development will also emphasize mobility, countermeasures, and non-traditional asymmetrical capabilities. We will also work to strengthen our defenses against the threats of cyber warfare, cognitive warfare, and ""unrestricted"" warfare to achieve our strategic goal of multidomain deterrence.The second is substantive reforms to our military reserve and mobilization systems. We need to enhance the quality of our reserve forces, as well as their weapons, equipment, and training, in order to achieve effective jointness with our regular forces. We also need to establish a standing, interdepartmental system connecting our reserve and mobilization systems. This system will help coordinate personnel and supplies, so that we can successfully mobilize during a transition from peacetime to war.Third is improvements to our military's management institutions. Today's young servicemembers have all grown up in a democratic society, and one of our most important missions will be to find ways for them to better utilize their professional skills in line with military needs.Some young servicemembers have difficulties adjusting to military needs, reflecting the gap between today's society and our military management institutions. We need to work to close that gap. We need to reduce negative societal views of the military and end the gradual erosion of our military's prestige and morale due to individual incidents caused by imperfect institutions.Thus, we will improve appeal and counseling mechanisms within the military, establish a fair and equitable incident investigation mechanism, and regularly evaluate personnel placements. In terms of education and training, we will strengthen leadership capacities across all levels of leadership and foster a modern management system that emphasizes professionalism.We need to strike a balance between the team-oriented military discipline needed for actual combat and society's respect for the individual.●Active International ParticipationOver the past four years, we have actively taken part in addressing major global issues, including counter-terrorism cooperation, humanitarian assistance, religious freedom, and nontraditional security.Throughout this global pandemic, we have been praised for providing selfless assistance to the international community wherever we are able.Taiwan has been deemed a democratic success story, a reliable partner, and a force for good in the world by the international community. All Taiwanese people should take pride in this.Over the next four years, we will continue to fight for our participation in international organizations, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with our allies, and bolster ties with the United States, Japan, Europe, and other like-minded countries.We will also participate more actively in regional cooperation mechanisms and work hand-in-hand with countries in the region to make concrete contributions to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.●Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsIn the face of complex and changing cross-strait circumstances, we have made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait over the past four years, gaining approval from the international community. We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security.Here, I want to reiterate the words ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue."" We will not accept the Beijing authorities' use of ""one country, two systems"" to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle.We will continue to handle cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. This has been our consistent position for maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Cross-strait relations have reached a historical turning point. Both sides have a duty to find a way to coexist over the long term and prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences. Faced with changing circumstances, I will hold firm to my principles, adopt an open attitude to resolve issues, and shoulder my responsibilities as President. I also hope that the leader on the other side of the Strait will take on the same responsibility, and work with us to jointly stabilize the long-term development of cross-strait relations.While we work to achieve national development, it is crucial that we optimize our government institutions over the next four years. Our Legislative Yuan will establish a constitutional amendment committee, giving us a platform to engage in dialogue and reach a consensus on constitutional reforms pertaining to government systems and people's rights.This democratic process will enable the constitutional system to progress with the times and align with the values of Taiwanese society. Our first priority should be to lower the voting age from 20 to 18, an issue on which both the majority and opposition parties are in agreement.In terms of judicial reform, I delivered on my promise to convene a National Congress on Judicial Reform, and we completed amendments to the Judges Act, the Attorney Regulation Act, the Constitutional Court Procedure Act, and the Labor Incident Act. This is all base work for the further improvement of our judicial system.However, our judicial reforms are still in transition, and our current progress has not yet met the public's expectations. I will continue to solicit opinions from across society and keep pressing forward. The people's dissatisfaction drives us to continue on the path of reform.Within the next four years, we need to implement a lay judge system, so that citizens can act as lay judges in court and become catalysts for judicial reform. This will help bridge the distance between the people and our judicial system, so that it aligns better with their expectations and earns their trust.All constitutional institutions must also continue on the path of reform. The Executive Yuan will reevaluate and reinitiate its organizational reform process, including the establishment of a specialized digital development agency and adjustments to all ministries in line with current needs. This will enable governance capabilities to be more responsive to the needs of national development.The National Human Rights Commission under the Control Yuan will officially be established in August of this year. This will be a milestone in our journey to place human rights at the center of Taiwan's national ethos, and marks the start of a new chapter for the Control Yuan.Our new Examination Yuan team will be instated in September, and I will ask them to propose a comprehensive reform plan and evaluate past policies, so that they can become an effective human resource department that can cultivate the talent a modern government needs.My fellow citizens, over the past 70 years, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has grown more resilient and unified through countless challenges. We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation. We have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Although we were once isolated in the world, we have always persisted in the values of democracy and freedom, no matter the challenges ahead of us. We will always remain committed to our common belief: Taiwan must help ourselves to help others, and when we help ourselves, others will help us.Many of the heroes in our fight against COVID-19 are here with us today, including members of our national face mask team, our Central Epidemic Command Center's public health team, and Premier Su Tseng-chang's team.There are many more heroes from all walks of life not in attendance today: medical workers, postal workers, pharmacists, convenience store clerks, taxi drivers, and many more.I may not be able to call out all of your names, but I want everyone to know that Taiwan has overcome countless challenges over the past 70 years, relying on not just one or two heroes, but thanks to countless heroes such as yourselves, working together to turn the wheels of history. You have helped make Taiwan a happy, safe, and prosperous place for generations to come.I want to express my respect to all of you. Every single person in Taiwan is a hero. Vice President Lai and I are honored to take on the responsibility you have entrusted to us.Taking on the responsibility of the President of the Republic of China in such difficult times brings me more pressure than joy. But I will not back down, because all of you are with me.The path forward will not be easy, and greater challenges await us. But we are a country that has persevered through even the greatest hardships. We, the 23 million people, have always been and will always be a community with a shared destiny.I truly hope that all of my fellow citizens will remember how it felt to come together to overcome the challenges of the past few months. The Republic of China can be united. Taiwan can be safe. Being Taiwanese can be an honor that makes you hold your head high.My dear citizens, the path ahead of us is long, and we are about to begin a new chapter in Taiwan's story. Taiwan's story belongs to each and every one of us, and it needs each and every one of us.I ask that the 23 million people of Taiwan act as our guides and partners. Let us pool our wisdom and courage and make this country a better place together. Thank you.（For the full text in Mandarin: 最特別的就職典禮 蔡總統：感謝台灣人民【演說全文】）",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005200003

5/22/2020,A new 'internet for everything' era on the way: expert,"By Kay Liu, CNA staff writerThe global COVID-19 pandemic has upended people's lives, giving terms such as stay at home, work from home, and social distancing added resonance and accentuating the importance of the internet in connecting with others and doing one's job.What many are wondering is if these lifestyle changes will become entrenched and workplaces permanently altered even as the pandemic eases and people can move freely again.Kenny Huang, the chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), says the trends are here to stay, and he foresees a world of ""internet for everything,"" in which even more tasks will be done online.""Before the pandemic, the internet was an information technology tool. For businesses, it was used to help with operations, marketing or other areas. But in the post-COVID-19 era, all business activities will likely be connected to the internet,"" Huang said in a recent interview with CNA.Huang is in as good a position as anybody to look into the future of cyberspace.His TWNIC, which manages domain names ending with .tw and internet protocol (IP) addresses in Taiwan, routinely conducts surveys and issues reports on internet use that offer insights into trends and developments in the online world and help businesses make decisions.He believes COVID-19 has already made the internet part of a new reality because people no longer feel that things have to be done face-to-face, at least judging by the surge in online traffic and bandwidth he has observed from Dec. 30, 2019 to March 23.Huang estimates that the internet is used in about 10 percent of everyday work at present, but he expects that to go much higher in the future as habits change.Possible risksThe increasingly internet-dependent world that Huang envisions could have a downside, however, with risks that already exist such as threats to cybersecurity or the monopolization of information potentially magnified, he said.He pointed to the possibility of a wider spread of disinformation if people become more reliant on digital media as a news source.""There are always new solutions, but there will always be new types of disruptions,"" said Huang, who used the example of fake news evolving from pure fiction to mixing in some facts to create misinformation.The new solutions, he said, are the likes of the review mechanism introduced by Facebook and Twitter and the work of organizations such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center.Social mediaSocial media could also fall prey to the growing importance of the internet, Huang suggested.At its core, the internet is about transmitting data and connecting devices, while social media plays the role of ""connecting people, who share and exchange the knowledge and views they have,"" he said.Interactions online may mirror those in the real world, but they are not perfect reflections, he said.They could become even more imperfect as reliance on the internet means users gravitate to only a few major service providers, and those platforms' user agreement and rules become, in effect, the rules of society, Huang cautioned.According to the center's annual Taiwan Internet Report for 2019, 79.2 percent of those surveyed between September and November last year used online social media, of whom 98.9 percent used Facebook, 38.8 percent used Instagram and only 5.6 percent used Twitter.Security concernsBehind the changing of habits seen during the global pandemic, the introduction of fifth generation wireless technology (5G) could also profoundly affect user habits by offering accessible, fast internet access at an affordable price.But its arrival has posed a challenge to Taiwan's government that may dominate the debate over cyberspace in the post-COVID-19 world -- balancing an open ecosystem with security concerns.In terms of 5G, the existing internet environment could make it easy for just a few companies to become dominant players, and they may be foreign and even hostile to Taiwan's interests. That has led Taiwan's government to intervene in the 5G arena by banning the use of essential equipment from certain suppliers or countries, especially China, on the grounds of national security, Huang said.Such fears have extended into other areas, including to internet services, he said, citing the example of China-based video-conferencing service Zoom, which has soared in popularity during the pandemic but was banned in Taiwan for government and school use over security concerns.Yet the government has not been as interventionist in other social or commercial domains, Huang said, citing the example of the growing popularity of foreign online streaming services that are full of content from China.The TWNIC report found that 84.5 percent of those surveyed watched online video or streamed content, 76.3 percent of which was produced in Taiwan, followed by China (42.2 percent), the United States (38.2 percent), Japan (35.2 percent), South Korea (34.4 percent) and Europe (13.2 percent).Striking a balance between free speech and China's attempts to use cultural power to spread its message in Taiwan will not be easy for the government, Huang said.Personal protectionMeanwhile, Huang warned that we all, at some level, will have to be prepared for the pitfalls of being heavily reliant on the online world.Shutdowns of service ""have happened and could still happen, and the impact on us will only increase because the time we spend and our reliance on internet services is growing,"" he said.""When using online services, people need to think ahead and have a plan B in case a company shuts down operations. Everyone should back up data routinely, update online accounts, update passwords, and not allow cookies when browsing online when they are not necessary,"" he advised.Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005220009

5/22/2020,Global support for Taiwan at record high: former U.S. official,"Washington, May 21 (CNA) Randall G. Schriver, a former United States assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said Thursday that Taiwan has won huge global support because of its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, despite China's suppression.""Taiwan's international recognition, international admiration for Taiwan, international support for Taiwan has almost never been higher, because we see the juxtaposition of how the PRC has handled the coronavirus and how Taiwan has,"" Schriver said at a virtual conference hosted by the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.Schriver also berated China for poaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies and seeking to exclude Taiwan from global bodies like the World Health Organization.The Communist Party of China's ""approach to Taiwan has failed, not by my measure but by their own measure,"" he said in the forum, titled U.S.-Taiwan Relations and Taiwan's Evolving Role in the Global Order.As a result of China's failed policies, it has destroyed any pathway for what it calls peaceful reunification and any remaining constituency for a future ""one China,"" Schriver said.China's proposed 'one country, two systems' unification framework ""never had much of a constituency in Taiwan, but polls now regarding what aspirations people have for a future arrangement ... have never been worse from China's perspective,"" he said. ""So it is very difficult to see re-sinification of Taiwan through peaceful means.""In light of that situation, Schriver said, the U.S. should be concerned about a growing temptation on the part of China to use more military tools and coercion against Taiwan.Under such circumstances, the U.S. and Taiwan should strengthen cooperation in the field of information sharing, he said, adding that he supports U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to help boost its defense capability.Also at the forum, Evan Medeiros, Penner Family chair in Asian studies and the Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations, said it is becoming more difficult for the U.S. to strike a balance in supporting Taiwan while seeking to build a constructive relationship with China, given that China is growing more confident in East Asia, and Taiwan is facing increasing pressure and coercion from Beijing.Medeiros said the U.S. should take its security pledge to Taiwan seriously, sell Taiwan more weapons based on the Taiwan Relations Act, and help Taiwan join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Chin-yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005220011
5/22/2020,"Government, opposition condemn China plans for new HK security laws","Taipei, May 22 (CNA) Taiwan's government and leading opposition party spoke out Friday against plans by the Chinese government to enact new national security laws in Hong Kong.At a press conference Thursday, Chinese officials announced that the National People's Congress, China's Legislature, would review a bill ""on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard national security.""While the text of the legislation has yet to be released, Chinese state media signaled that it will provide legal grounds for the central government to intervene against activities in Hong Kong it deems subversive to state power.In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday that the proposed legislation demonstrates the Chinese government's inability to reflect on the true causes of dissatisfaction in Hong Kong, as it instead seeks to blame its problems on foreign interference and independence activists.Alex Huang (黃重諺), a spokesperson for Taiwan's Presidential Office, called on Beijing to respect Hong Kongers' legitimate democratic aspirations and to enter into dialogue with them, rather than further restricting their freedoms.Both of Taiwan's major political parties also issued statements condemning the legislation.Hung Yu-chien (洪于茜), a spokesperson for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said Taiwanese people across party lines are concerned about the situation in Hong Kong and called on Beijing to respect the region's autonomy.The proposed legislation will bypass Hong Kong's Legislature and violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration's guarantee of autonomy for the region, Hung went on, adding that Hong Kong people's distrust of Beijing, which led to major protest movements in 2014 and 2019, would only be exacerbated by the plans.As far as the KMT is concerned, the Republic of China (Taiwan's formal name) is a sovereign country, and the ""one country, two systems"" model espoused by China is absolutely not on the table, Hung said.The governing Democratic Progressive Party, meanwhile, said the plans made it possible that anyone in Hong Kong could end up as the next Lee Ming-che (李明哲), and ""declared again to the world that 'one country, two systems' is dead.""Lee, a Taiwanese pro-democracy activist, disappeared in March 2017 after entering China from Macau and was subsequently jailed for ""subverting state power.""In an opening address to the People's Congress on Friday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克强) said the country would continue to oppose Taiwan independence and promote reunification with China.(By Yu Hsiang, Wen Kuei-hsiang and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005220012

5/22/2020,"Torrential rains to ease Saturday, but threat remains: CWB","Taipei, May 22 (CNA) The torrential rainfall that drenched Taiwan on Friday could ease up on Saturday, but heavy rainfall could still affect the central and southern parts of the country, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) warned.Taiwan is likely to see less rainfall over the weekend as the plum rain front that brought the deluge moves south toward the Bashi Channel and southeasterly winds weaken, forecasters said.According to the CWB, northern Taiwan and low-lying areas in central Taiwan should see milder weather, though they could still get heavy rain, defined by the CWB as more than 80 millimeters of rainfall over a 24 hour-period or 40 mm of rainfall in one hour.Mountainous areas in central Taiwan and low-lying areas in southern Taiwan could see extremely heavy rain, which the CWB defines as more than 200 mm of rainfall over a 24 hour-period or over 100 mm in three hours.In the south, mountainous areas in Chiayi County and some low-lying areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung could even see torrential rain, equal to more than 350 millimeters of rainfall over a 24-hour period, the bureau said.In mountainous areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, ""extreme torrential rain"" of more than 500 mm of rainfall could fall over a 24-hour period, the bureau forecast.Meanwhile, lightning, strong gusts, rock falls, mudslides and flooding are likely islandwide, according to the CWB.On Friday, some schools and offices were closed, and flooding and traffic disruptions were reported around Taiwan due to the inclement weather.Parts of Kaohsiung and Pingtung, where water levels were calf-deep, saw the most severe flooding in Taiwan.The heaviest rainfall was recorded in Sandimen Township in Pingtung, with 550 mm of precipitation accumulated between midnight and 6 p.m. Friday.In northern Taiwan's Hsinchu, rock falls blocked railroad tracks at around noon, causing delays for 1,400 passengers on 10 Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) trains.Several roads, including sections of the Southern Cross-Island Highway in the south, were also closed as a precautionary measure, transportation authorities said.According to the Education Ministry, 26 schools across Taiwan, most of which were in Tainan and Kaohsiung, have reported damage of up to NT$1.59 million (US$53,200) due to the torrential rains.(By Wang Shu-fen, Chen Chao-fu, Chen Chi-chung and Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005220018
5/22/2020,Few mentions of Taiwan in annual speech by Chinese premier: scholars,"Taipei, May 22 (CNA) Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克強) made scant mention of Taiwan in an important annual speech Friday, reflecting China's focus on its economy as it juggles a trade war with the United States and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, according to scholars of cross-strait relations.On Friday morning, Li delivered the government's work report -- a speech often compared to the U.S. state of the union address -- at the opening of China's annual parliamentary meeting, the National People's Congress.The 14,000 word speech was shorter than in previous years, which have averaged around 20,000 words, and also notable in that its references to Taiwan were limited to about 100 words.Tung Li-wen (董立文), an advisory board member at Taiwan Thinktank, told CNA Friday that the relatively minor references to Taiwan in the speech show that China currently has its hands full managing the economic impact of its trade war with the U.S. and the COVID-19 pandemic.As relates to Taiwan, Tung noted that last week China unveiled 11 incentives targeting Taiwanese businesses operating in China, showing that the country needs to retain Taiwanese talent and technology amid the tough economic climate.Chang Yu-shao (張宇韶), deputy secretary of the Cross-Strait Policy Association, characterized the language on Taiwan in the speech as ""soft in tone, but not without its jagged edges.""Li did not invoke political concepts such as ""one country, two systems"" or the ""1992 consensus"" in reference to Taiwan, and instead relied on broader appeals to Chinese nationhood, Chang said.At the same time, the speech omitted the word ""peaceful"" in its reference to ""national reunification,"" he said.The speech's more hardline content came in the announcement of new national security legislation for Hong Kong, though this also contained a sort of implicit threat to Taiwan, Chang said.Meanwhile, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded to Li's speech Friday with language from President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) recent inaugural address.In a statement, the MAC rejected China's ""one country, two systems"" model for ""downgrading Taiwan and undermining the cross-strait status quo.""Instead, it urged Beijing to accept Tsai's principles of ""peace, parity, democracy and dialogue"" as the foundation for cross-strait interaction.(By Lai Yen-hsi and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sports/202005220019

3/4/2020,TSMC teams up with Broadcom in 5nm process development,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has joined forces with U.S.-based integrated circuit designer Broadcom Inc. in advanced 5 nanometer process development.In a statement released Tuesday, TSMC said it has teamed up with Broadcom to strengthen the Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) integrated circuit packaging platform that supports 5nm technology.According to TSMC, CoWoS provides best-in-breed performance and highest integration density for high performance computing applications, and the particular wafer level system integration platform offers a wide range of interposer sizes, a number of high bandwidth memory (HBM) cubes, and package sizes.The cooperation with Broadcom means TSMC will provide one-stop services from IC packaging to pure wafer foundry services to Broadcom, which has come on board with other foreign tech giants such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Huawei Technolgies Inc., to use the Taiwanese chipmaker's 5nm process technology.In addition to contract chip production, TSMC has started high-end IC packaging operations in a bid to provide its customers with a wide range of comprehensive services.The 7 nanometer process is the latest technology the chipmaker has begun mass producing, while the company is also developing the more sophisticated 5mn and 3mn processes.TSMC is scheduled to launch mass production of the 5nm process in the first half of this year. The 3nm process is expected to begin commercial production in 2022.Through its partnership with Broadcom, TSMC's next generation CoWoS packaging services provide bandwidth of up to 2.7 terabytes per second, which is 2.7 times faster than the CoWoS solution the chipmaker previously offered in 2016.TSMC said with higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the CoWoS solution jointly developed with Broadcom is well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as deep learning, workloads for 5G networking and power-efficient data centers.At an investor conference held in mid-January, TSMC said the company expects to benefit from solid demand for smartphones, high performance computer (HPC) devices, Internet of Things related applications and automotive electronics this year.Amid optimism over global demand, TSMC has devoted itself to high-end technology development, a move expected to boost its global competitive edge and sustain the company's lead over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., which has started advanced technology processes with an eye to gaining a larger share of the global market.For the development of its high-end processes, TSMC has said capital expenditure for 2020 is expected to range from US$15-16 billion, the highest level in the company's history.Currently, TSMC has more than 50 percent of the global pure wafer foundry market.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003040004

The contagion could also hurt private consumption in the U.S.Since the novel coronavirus first emerged at the end of December, more than 96,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with infections in more than 80 countries and territories and more than 3,300 deaths, the majority of which have been in China.""Such unfavorable circumstances are expected to pose threats to Taiwan's export-oriented economy,"" Su said.It was no surprise that Friday's selling in Taiwan focused on the bellwether electronics sector, which depends heavily on global demand, Su said.As of 10:58 a.m., TSMC had lost 2.01 percent to NT$316.50 with 25.07 million shares changing hands after its American depositary receipts (ADRs) lost 2.37 percent on U.S. markets overnight.Led by TSMC, the electronics sector was down 1.43 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index was down 1.76 percent.Also in the high tech sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had lost 1.93 percent to NT$81.10, while Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., was little changed at NT$4,600.00.Following a 1.45 percent fall in its ADRs overnight, integrated circuit packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. had lost 2.99 percent to NT$71.40, while IC designer MediaTek Inc. had lost 1.17 percent to NT$380.50.Selling was also seen among large cap old economy stocks with Formosa Plastics Corp. down 1.61 percent at NT$91.80 and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 2.15 percent at NT$68.20.In the financial sector, Fubon Financial Holding Co. had fallen 1.88 percent to NT$44.30, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. had lost 1.37 percent to NT$39.60.""The silver lining was that the magnitude of the fall in the local market was not as heavy as elsewhere in the world as the TWSE remained awash in liquidity and many investors appeared willing to park their money here,"" Su said.""I expect the Taiex will see strong support at around the 240-day moving average of 11,049 points,"" Su said. ""It's also possible that government-led funds will jump into the market to prevent further losses.""(By Frances Huang) Enditem/cc/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003060003

3/13/2020,Stabilization fund ready to shore up equity market: MOF,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Finance Minister Su Jain-rong (蘇建榮) on Friday said the National Financial Stabilization Fund is ready to lend support to the local equity market and its committee could meet at anytime if necessary, amid global volatility spurred by escalating fears over the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 worldwide.At a news conference held at around 8:15 a.m., 45 minutes before the local equity market opened, Su urged investors to remain confident in Taiwan's economic fundamentals, saying the Ministry of Finance, the central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission will come up with measures to stabilize the stock market.Su made the comments as concerns over the spread of COVID-19 intensfied, sending ripples through global financial markets.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,352 points or almost 10 percent, the largest single session drop since Oct. 19, 1987, when the index shed 22.6 percent amid a global financial crisis, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index also dropped more than 9 percent even though the U.S. Federal Reserve took the unusual step of injecting funds into the market.Despite Su's remarks, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taiex still opened down 331.29 points at 10,091.03 and the weakness continued on panic-led selling across the board.Su said the stabilization fund is watching the local equity market closely and its committee could meet anytime, if necessary, and jump into the market to counter the impact of global volatility.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.The fund intervenes in the market when it receives authorization from the fund committee, which is currently managed by Vice Finance Minister Juan Ching-hwa (阮清華), who is executive secretary of the fund.However, Su said with the virus, originally from the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading worldwide, it is no surprise that the global economy faces severe challenges with plunging equity markets around the world.In addition to the dive on the U.S. markets, the equity markets in France, Germany and the United Kingdom also tumbled 12.28 percent, 12.24 percent and 10.87 percent, respectively, Thursday.Compared with the markets in the U.S. and Europe, Juan said, Taiwanese equities appear resilient despite the ongoing scare over the virus. He cited data from Feb. 24 to March 12, showing that the Taiex fell 10.82 percent, while the Dow dropped 26.88 percent, and the markets in France, Germany and the U.K. shed 32.93 percent, 32.54 percent and 29.26 percent, respectively.The relatively small drop in Taiwan came as the country has executed efficient and effective measures to contain the spread of the virus, Juan said, adding that healthy economic fundamentals and attractive dividend yields in the equity market have enabled Taiwanese stocks to fend off unfavorable external factors to some extent.""It is unnecessary for investors to panic,"" Juan said, ""They should have faith in the local equity market.""(By Wu Chia-jung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003130003

3/17/2020,Taiwan shares plummet but losses capped,"Taipei, March 17 (CNA) Taiwan shares slid Tuesday morning after a plunge on U.S. markets overnight amid rising concerns of a recession due to the global novel coronavirus pandemic, dealers said.Selling focused on market heavyweights, especially electronics companies such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), but bargain hunting set in to limit the losses, they said.As of 10 a.m., the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), the Taiex, had fallen 224.13 points, or 2.31 percent, at 9,493.64 after hitting a low of 9,371.35 on turnover of NT$97.50 billion (US$3.22 billion).The Taiex opened down 1.84 percent after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.9 percent overnight, the steepest fall since the Black Monday"" market crash in 1987 despite an interest rate cut of one percentage point by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Sunday.Downward pressure continued as investors dumped large cap stocks such as TSMC to push down the Taiex by as much as 340 points before some buying emerged, dealers said.""Global equity markets reacted to the surprise Fed rate cut badly because it led investors to think the Fed is worried that the economic impact of the virus spread will be more serious than expected,"" MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said.The Fed's rate cut was the second emergency cut in the past 15 days and sent its key interest rates to zero after the previous cut of 0.50 percentage points on March 3.""Market sentiment was also hurt by (U.S. President Donald) Trump's latest statement, pointing to a likely recession caused by the spread of the virus,"" Tang said, referring to Trump's comment that the pandemic could continue into August and hurt the U.S. economy.""But the Taiex seemed to obtain some support after it fell to 9,371, the most recent intraday low dating back to Jan. 6, 2018, as some bargain hunters thought it was a good buying point,"" Tang said.""Among the bargain hunters, I think, are government-led funds since the government did not want to see another plunge today,"" Tang said. On Monday, the Taiex fell 4.06 percent to close below the 10,000-point mark.Among the large cap stocks, TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, had lost 2.53 percent to NT$269.50 as of 10 a.m. after hitting a low of NT$265.00.""Due to the support from government-led funds, TSMC appeared resilient compared with a 14 percent fall of its American depositary receipts on the U.S. market overnight,"" Tang said.Also in the electronics sector, integrated circuit designer MeidaTek Inc. had lost 0.63 percent to NT$318.00, off a low of MT$308.00 and iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had dropped 0.14 percent to NT$71.00, off a low of NT$70.00.Bucking the downturn, Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., had gained 0.13 percent to NT$3,730.00 after hitting a low of NT$3,650.00.""After the Fed's dramatic rate cuts, it is very likely Taiwan's central bank will follow suit in its quarterly policymaking meeting scheduled for Thursday, so financial stocks were also under pressure due to an expected narrowing in interest spreads,"" Tang said.In the financial sector, Fubon Financial Holding Co. had lost 2.50 percent to NT$37.10, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. had dropped 2.79 percent to NT$34.80 as of 10 a.m.""The ability of Taiwan's market to shed its current weakness will completely depend on whether the pandemic is contained worldwide,"" Tang said.(By Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003170003

3/28/2020,Extreme heavy rain alert issued for Taitung,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) An extreme heavy rain alert has been issued for Taitung County in southeastern Taiwan on Saturday due to the effects of a weather front, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).The CWB said precipitation on Orchid Island of Taitung is expected to become apparent and will continue into Saturday afternoon due to the weather front, warning people living in low-lying areas of floodwaters.The bureau has lifted a heavy rain warning it had previously imposed earlier Saturday for the areas south of Taoyuan City as the weather front is passing, but it warned of possible occasional heavy rainfall in northern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula in the south.Under the bureau's definition, heavy rain means accumulated rainfall of 80 millimeters or more within a 24-hour period or rainfall of 40 mm or more in an hour, while extreme heavy rain is defined as accumulated rainfall of 200 mm or more within 24 hours.Along with the rainfall brought by the weather front, an accelerating northeasterly wind system is expected to cool northern Taiwan down as temperature highs are forecast to fall to 21-24 degrees Celsius Saturday from about 30 degrees a day earlier.Daytime temperatures in central and southern Taiwan are expected to fall in a moderate pace to 27-28 and 29-30 degrees, respectively, on Saturday, from 31-32 degrees a day earlier, the CWB said.With the weather front intensifying, the CWB said, the mercury around Taiwan will fall further from Saturday night through early Sunday morning.The bureau forecast temperatures will dip to 15 degrees in northern Taiwan, 16-17 degrees in central Taiwan and 18-19 degrees in the south on Sunday.It urged the public to keep a close eye on a wide day-night temperature gap, in particular in central and southern Taiwan, and to stay warm.In addition, the CWB said, the wind system is also expected to bring in strong winds for the areas north of Tainan, eastern Taiwan including Orchid Island and Green Island, the Hengchun Peninsula, as well as the outlying Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands Saturday.Such low temperatures are expected to continue into Sunday but drier weather is likely, with only sporadic showers expected in northeastern Taiwan and the mountainous areas in the north, the CWB said.Meanwhile, air quality in the north as well as Yilan, Hualien and Taitung in eastern Taiwan and the outlying Matsu and Penghu islands were rated ""good"" on Saturday, while it was ""fair"" in central Taiwan, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south, as well as Kinmen, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said.(By Chen Chun-shuo and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003280001

3/28/2020,U.S. reportedly eyes curb of TSMC's supply to Huawei,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) The United States has been aiming to curb the supply of chips sold by contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to China's Huawei Technologies Co. through planned heavier sanctions against the Chinese telecom equipment giant, according to a Reuters report.The report said while tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating with both sides blaming each other for spreading the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Trump administration has a plan to introduce new measures to further restrict global chip sales to Huawei.Under the proposed new rules, the report, dated Thursday in Washington, said foreign companies that use U.S. production equipment to roll out their chips would be required to obtain a U.S. license ahead of sales of certain chips to Huawei, which was blacklisted last year.Citing unnamed sources, the report said the measures are aimed at curbing supplies of chips to Huawei's integrated circuit design subsidiary arm HiSilicon Technologies Co. from TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.The report said it remained unknown whether President Donald Trump will approve the new sanction measures since he appeared to oppose the measures in February. If the new measures are imposed, Huawei and TSMC, as well as American enterprises, will feel the pinch, it said.The report quoted a research paper written by China-based Everbright Securities last year as saying most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials.""This is going to have a far more negative impact on U.S. companies than it will on Huawei, because Huawei will develop their own supply chain,"" trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said in the report. ""Ultimately, Huawei will find alternatives.""In Taipei, TSMC said it was unable to respond to any ""hypothetical questions"" and would not comment on any individual clients.According to a market estimate, Huawei accounts for about 10 percent of TSMC's total sales. Market analysts said if the strict rules are imposed, TSMC will see its shipments squeezed.After the possible heavier sanctions against Huawei surfaced, shares of TSMC gave up earlier gains of 2.14 percent on the Friday trading session in Taipei, falling 2.50 percent to close at NT$273.00 (US$9.03) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index also came off an earlier high of 9,954.86 points, down 0.38 percent to end at 9,698.92.On Friday, foreign institutional investors sold a net 5.23 million TSMC shares, stopping a three-day streak of a net buy, but for the entire week, such investors recorded a net buy of 28.47 million TSMC shares.TSMC's American depositary receipts on the U.S. market also fell 5.94 percent overnight as the market came under pressure amid fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.(By Emmanuelle Tseng, Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003280003

3/31/2020,All 214 evacuees from Hubei placed in quarantine,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The 214 Taiwanese nationals who returned to Taiwan on Monday night after being stranded in Hubei province by the new coronavirus outbreak have been placed in quarantine and will soon be tested for COVID-19.The passengers were taken by about a dozen tour buses to an undisclosed quarantine venue in northern Taiwan at around 1 a.m. Tuesday after undergoing health screenings at the airport, and will be quarantined for 14 days.Military servicemen chemically disinfected the vehicles after the passengers reached the quarantine facility.All returnees will be tested for COVID-19 within 48 hours, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center.The handling of these Taiwanese who were stuck in Hubei province after it went into lockdown in late January to contain the spread of the new coronavirus has been controversial.They were all put on a list of people who required special permission to return to Taiwan, unlike other Taiwanese currently returning from areas where the virus seems much more active, such as the United States and Europe.Those on the list are being required to return on special pre-arranged flights, which the government is describing as ""charter-like flights,"" and then put in quarantine in government-run facilities after arriving home.People arriving from other parts of China or other parts of the world can take regularly scheduled commercial flights to Taiwan and self-quarantine at home for 14 days.The 214 Taiwanese had to make their way on their own from Hubei province to Shanghai's Pudong International Airport to catch the special flight operated by China Airlines, which departed at 8:02 p.m. Monday and arrived at Taoyuan International Airport at 9:38 p.m.It was the second of two special flights contracted by the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a semi-official agency that handles cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in the absence of formal bilateral ties, to bring home Taiwan citizens stuck in Hubei.The first was arranged late Sunday, when 153 Taiwanese returned home.These Taiwanese had been stranded in Hubei since late January but were able to leave the area after restrictions on the movement of people there were lifted on March 25.Many others are still stuck in Wuhan, but will be able to leave if restrictions there are lifted on April 8 as scheduled.(By Liu Chien Pang and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310002

However, it was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.It has not been a member of the United Nations or the WHO since then.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310005
3/31/2020,Hon Hai shares edge higher on 2019 results,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker that churns out many of Apple's iPhones, moved higher Tuesday morning after it reported an increase in earnings per share (EPS) for 2019, dealers said.The gains were limited, however, as investors were wary of a fall in Hon Hai's profit margins amid escalating competition in the global market and concerns over a possible delay in the launch of the next generation iPhones amid the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.As of 11:38 a.m., shares of Hon Hai had gained 0.29 percent to NT$70.20 (US$2.32), off a high of NT$70.50, on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index was up 1.13 percent at 9,738.67 following gains in the U.S. overnight.In a statement released Monday, Hon Hai said it posted net profit of NT$115.31 billion in 2019, down 10.65 percent from a year earlier, but its EPS of NT$8.32 beat its EPS of NT$8.03 in 2018.Analysts said the EPS growth largely resulted from Hon Hai's move to cut its capitalization by about 20 percent in 2018 to NT$138.63 billion to maintain its EPS above the NT$8 level.It was the first time the company had lowered its capital since it first listed publicly in June 1991.Though EPS rose in 2019, the company's lower gross margin and operating profit margin fell due to intensifying global competition, giving investors pause.The company had a gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- of 5.91 percent in 2019, down 0.36 percentage points from a year earlier, and its net margin -- the difference between its gross profit and its total expenses -- was down 0.29 percentage points to 2.15 percent in 2019.Its operating profit margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- was also down 0.42 percentage points to 2.15 percent.In addition to cutting its paid-in capital, Hon Hai was also able to maintain its EPS above NT$8 in 2019 because of efforts to automate its production, a fall in the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, and a sharp decline in the losses of subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd.The Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, in which Hon Hai holds a 62.8 percent stake, cut its net loss to US$12.29 million in 2019 from US$857.12 million a year earlier because of efforts to keep costs down.Hon Hai had consolidated sales of NT$5.34 trillion in 2019, the highest in the company's history, but they were only up 0.92 percent from a year earlier.Hon Hai said it has scheduled an annual general meeting for June 23.Analysts have estimated that Hon Hai's sales in the first quarter of 2020 will fall 40 percent from NT$1.74 trillion in the fourth quarter to below NT$1 trillion because of slow season effects and falling demand caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.(By Chung Jung-feng and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310006

""So, we are here today calling for the MOL to mandate that dormitories be located away from the workplace to save the lives of migrant workers and firefighters.""Prior to the Taoyuan fire earlier this month, six Vietnamese migrant workers in Taoyuan City died in December 2017 in a factory fire that engulfed their dormitory, which was on the upper level of a factory warehouse made of sheet iron. The structure belonged to Sican Co., which runs a factory that produces solar control window film.Four months later, a blaze at a facility operated by Chin Poon, a printed circuit board factory in Taoyuan, claimed the lives of two Thai workers who were trapped in a dormitory on the factory premises, while six firefighters died in the rescue efforts.""The firefighters rushed into the burning factory because it was their duty to save lives,"" Chu Chih-yu (朱智宇), secretary general of the National Association for Firefighters' Rights, said at Tuesday's rally. ""But if people didn't live inside the factory, then the firefighters would not have had to put their lives on the line and enter the burning building.""The migrant workers at the rally, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, along with Taiwanese supporters, shouted slogans and burned incense at a makeshift altar in memory of those who had perished in the factory fires.A Filipino, who asked to be identified only as Arturo, said when he was working at a factory in Taoyuan last year, he was housed in a dorm in the basement of the building with nine coworkers.""There was once an earthquake and we felt extremely scared because there was only one exit from the basement. Imagine a fire -- we all would have been trapped,"" said Arturo, whose right hand was severed in a factory accident last year.Another Philippine worker said, however, that work safety is not the sole responsibility of the employer, and there is no guarantee that factory employees will be safe even if their dorms are offsite.""I have seen workers cooking in their rooms when they are not supposed to, plugging as many as 10 power adaptors to one outlet in the wall, and bringing cellphones into the work area,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named.Common sense is what is most important when it comes to safety, she said, adding that she works with toxic, flammable and combustible materials on a daily basis.In response to the protesters' calls, Huang Wei-cheng (黃偉誠), a section chief at the MOL's Workforce Development Agency, said the ministry is planning to amend the law to make it mandatory for factories that have onsite dorms to file safety reports, which would include a declaration of any pyrophoric substances or flammable gases on the site.The legislation, which is expected to be completed by June, will also state how often safety checks will be carried out at factories, according to a statement issued later by the MOL.Hsu, however, expressed skepticism about such safety checks, saying that there are some 100,000 dormitories throughout Taiwan for migrant workers, while the number of inspectors responsible for checking on the welfare of the workers totals only 274.""Work safety and the general welfare checks are usually carried out once, when a migrant worker first arrives in Taiwan, due to a lack of manpower,"" Hsu said.Among the 719,847 migrant workers in Taiwan, 455,934 are employed in the industrial sector, according to MOL statistics valid as of the end of February.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310011

3/31/2020,Transgender activists release 7 policy demands,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Activists marked Tuesday's International Transgender Day of Visibility by announcing seven policy demands based on what they called the largest-ever survey of Taiwan's transgender community.At a press conference, the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) announced the results of the survey, which was open to respondents who identify as transgender under the broad definition of the term -- those whose gender identities or expressions differ from what is typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.The survey, which was conducted online March 14-25, received 518 valid responses, which served as the basis for the seven policy proposals, the TAPCPR said.The alliance's first two demands were to end the practice of requiring sex reassignment surgery for people seeking to change the gender designation on their national identification cards, as well as allowing coverage of elective sex reassignment surgeries under Taiwan's National Health Insurance program.According to a 2013 report on Taiwan's implementation of human rights by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the former requirement could constitute a form of torture, the group said.These concerns were further borne out in survey results, the TAPCPR said, in which 30.42 percent of the respondents said they were unsure about the safety of such surgeries, 29.54 percent doubted their necessity and 52.3 percent considered them prohibitively expensive.In its third and fourth demands, meanwhile, the group called for acceptance of the transgender community's collective diversity and for reforms of Taiwan's gender designation policies based on consultations with the transgender community.As an example of this diversity, the group cited survey results showing that 52 percent of the respondents identified as either male or female, while 48 percent identified themselves as nonbinary, gender-fluid or agender.Given the complexity of gender identity revealed in the survey results, the government should abandon the poorly received ""third gender policy"" it proposed in 2017, and instead should adopt new guidelines based on consultations with the transgender community, the alliance said.Fifth, the alliance called for an abolition of legal distinctions between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages.Because Taiwan's marriage equality law was passed as a special act rather than a revision of the Civil Code, which governs opposite-sex marriage, the legal rights enjoyed by the two forms of marriage vary, with a disproportionate impact on transgender individuals, the group said.For example, if a person married under the Civil Code seeks to change their gender designation and have their marriage recognized under the marriage equality act, they lose the right to adopt children as a couple and can only adopt their partner's biological children as a step-parent, the group said.On a broader social level, the alliance recommended starting gender identity education beginning in elementary school as a way of pre-empting the experience of the 47.68 percent of survey respondents who said they were bullied, discriminated against or otherwise mistreated at school.Similarly, the government should include transgender people in its monitoring of hate crimes, given that 37.3 percent of those surveyed said they had suffered workplace discrimination, the alliance said.Overall, the survey respondents reported suffering a wide range of social difficulties related to their gender identification.These included 55.41 percent who feared discrimination in public restrooms, 24.32 percent who delayed or avoided medical treatment and 22.01 percent who had been discriminated against while shopping for clothes or accessories.Another 18.53 percent said they had been sexually harassed or attacked in public, while 15.83 percent were afraid to call the police in an emergency, according to the survey results.(By Yang Su-min and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310015
3/31/2020,Constitutional Court hears debate on decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Grand justices heard arguments at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday on whether a criminal law that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after several judges asked for an interpretation of the law.Article 239 of Taiwan's Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.Eighteen judges and a male who was convicted of adultery have asked the Constitutional Court in recent years to overturn Interpretation 554, which determined that Article 239 was constitutional.The most recent one was a judge surnamed Chen (陳) from the Miaoli District Court who mainly hears cases related to ""offenses against marriage,"" who felt Article 239 may violate the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan).The court finally agreed to hear the case and heard arguments Tuesday, some of which centered around Interpretation 554.The interpretation, which was made in 2002, ruled that the freedom of sexual behavior is inseparably related to the personality of individuals, and every person is free to decide whether or not and with whom to have sexual affairs.Such freedom is, however, legally protected only if it is not detrimental to the social order or public interest as provided in Article 22 of the Constitution, and therefore the freedom of sexual behavior is subject to the restriction put on it by marriage and the family system, the ruling said.One of the judges arguing for decriminalization, Wu Chih-chiang (吳志強), said adultery is not the only factor that shakes a marriage and therefore there was no need to intervene with ""national punishment.""He argued that Article 239 could lead to unfairness and inequality in administering punishment, forcing people to maintain an unwanted marriage.Wu was referring to complaints by supporters of the decriminalization of adultery that under Article 239 the crime of adultery cannot be prosecuted without a complaint by the victim, and if one spouse withdraws charges against the other, the withdrawal does not apply to the outside party.That has led in practice to women likely to be pressured by their husbands to drop the charges against them during the proceedings, yet the cases against the mistresses go ahead.Judge Chang Yuan-sen (張淵森) argued that the purpose of criminalizing adultery was to protect the family and social morals and prevent people from suffering in a miserable marriage.Yet while the law gives people the ability to get married and divorced freely, it cannot use criminal law to ""threaten"" people into acting faithfully in a marriage, he contended.Many factors cause suffering in a marriage, including the relationship between the wife and her mother-in-law, child education problems, financial issues, and sexual relations, Chang said.""If one person suffers in a marriage, it does not mean the other party has to be punished. Suffering should not be a reason for punishment in the Criminal Code,"" he said.Chi Hui-jung (紀惠容), a former executive director of the Garden of Hope Foundation who attended the Constitutional Court as a friend of the court to present her opinions, called Article 239 a law that punishes women.Although there are more men charged for adultery than women, in the end more women, most of them the mistresses in the cases, are convicted, she said.At the same time, she argued, the crime of adultery uses the Criminal Code to deter people from having affairs, but in a society that now frowns on using corporal punishment to discipline children, it is inappropriate to use ""threats"" to keep marriages together.Deputy Minister of Justice Tsai Pi-chung (蔡碧仲) argued, however, that the criminalization of adultery is aimed at safeguarding the marriage and family system.To support her position, Tsai cited Interpretation No. 544, which says the root of the nation's marital system lies in the freedom of personality, with such social functions as the maintenance of the order of human relationships and gender equality, and the raising of children.To insure an enduring and unimpaired system of marriage, the state may of course enact relevant rules to require a husband and wife to be mutually bound to each other by the duty of faithfulness, the interpretation says.The freedoms of individuals should still be restricted by the need to maintain social order, Tsai argued, and therefore Article 239 is not unconstitutional.(By Lin Chang-shun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310016
3/31/2020,Prosecutors voice support for decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310017
3/31/2020,Taiwan further expands screening to curb COVID-19 pandemic,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Tuesday announced that it will expand the scope of COVID-19 coronavirus screening tests to all patients with pneumonia and those who have lost their sense of smell or taste, effective immediately.Henceforth, patients with such symptoms will be required to undergo coronavirus screening tests, said CECC expert Chang Shan-chwen (張上淳) during a news briefing.Chang said the CECC decided to expand screening to patients with pneumonia in the hope that doing so will make it easier to detect those infected with COVID-19 more quickly and before they infect others.The decision came after two of the most recent cases were individuals with no recent overseas travel history, who tested positive for coronavirus only after doctors sent their samples for screening following a pneumonia diagnosis, according to the CECC.As of Monday, 24 of the more than 300 confirmed cases in Taiwan were found to have lost their sense of smell or taste, prompting the CECC to subject those with such symptoms to screening, he added.Previously, Taiwan only conducted COVID-19 tests on those with respiratory symptoms and fever who had recently traveled to countries with coronavirus outbreaks, or who had contact with coronavirus patients.The CECC last week further expanded the scope of screening to medical and healthcare workers with suspected infection symptoms in order to prevent possible cluster infections in the nation's healthcare system.Taiwan recorded 16 new infections on Tuesday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 322 with five deaths since the coronavirus emerged in China at the end of last year, according to CECC statistics.As of Tuesday, the CEEC had conducted 31,800 tests since the epidemic started in late December.(By Chen Wei-ting, Yu Hsiao-han and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310018

3/31/2020,Taiwan's surgical mask output hits 13 million per day,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's daily surgical mask output has hit 13 million, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Tuesday.The current daily output is more than four times the amount that Taiwan was capable of producing in early February, when Taiwan produced an average of 3.2 million surgical masks per day.That amount, however, is far from enough to meet the demand for surgical masks, which are widely used in Taiwan to prevent against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.In response to the high demand, the government banned the export of all surgical masks in late January, requisitioned all domestically produced masks, and instituted a rationing system to limit the number of masks people could buy per week.It also purchased 92 mask production lines, which have been set up in 40 days and have largely contributed to the significant surge in output.With the increase in output, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced Monday that people would be able to buy more masks under the rationing system in April.From April 9, residents will have access to nine masks for adults every 14 days, up from three per week at present, while the quota for children's masks will remain at 10 every two weeks, the CECC said.The MOEA is also discussing whether to purchase production lines that can produce N95 masks, which are able to filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles and are mainly used by medical workers on the frontlines.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310020

""MOFA will continue to work with the U.S. and other like-minded countries to advance our shared values and common goals and deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership on the global stage.""The TAIPEI Act was first introduced in the U.S. Senate by Cory Gardner last May, with Republican Congressman John Curtis unveiling a similar version in the House of Representatives in October, amid Beijing's continued efforts to squeeze Taiwan's international space.The legislation was passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier this month and later signed into law by Trump.The Act calls on the U.S. government to further Taiwan-U.S. bilateral trade and economic relations, help Taiwan participate in international organizations, and strengthen Taiwan's partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific region and in the world, according to Ou.It also authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider altering its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious actions to undermine Taiwan's security and prosperity, she said.The Republic of China (Taiwan), a founding member of the WHO, was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.International support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.Taiwan has been trying to rejoin the WHO since 1997. From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was able to participate in the WHA as an observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" with Beijing's approval, as cross-Taiwan Strait relations were warmer at the time.Since 2017, however, the year after President Tai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) took office, the Chinese government has been blocking Taiwan's efforts to participate in the WHA, due to differences between Taipei and Beijing over the so called ""1992 Consensus.""The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China,"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310022
3/31/2020,U.S. military aircraft fly near Taiwan for 4th time this month,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A United States military aircraft was reported flying near Taiwan's southern airspace Tuesday, marking the fourth time this month a U.S. warplane had been spotted operating near the country.The U.S. Navy P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft was operating in the South China Sea, according to a flight chart posted on Twitter on Tuesday by Aircraft Spots, a military air movement tracker.Asked to comment, Taiwanese military spokesman Shih Shun-wen (史順文) did not directly confirm the movement, saying only that the nation's armed forces are closely monitoring the country's surrounding waters and airspace.Based on charts released by Aircraft Spots and Taiwan's own records, the latest incident was the fourth time in March that a U.S. warplane was found to have been operating near the nation's airspace.The previously three occurrences all happened last week: on March 25 by an EP-3E ARIES II reconnaissance aircraft, on March 26 by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber and a KC-135 tanker, and on March 27 by another B-52 bomber and an RC-135U reconnaissance aircraft.Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS McCampbell conducted operations in the Taiwan Strait on March 25, according to information released by the U.S. Pacific Fleet on its Facebook page.The U.S. military's frequent operations around Taiwan, both in the air and at sea in the past week are designed to show that the U.S. is continuing its monitoring of the region, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, local military analysts told CNA.Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), a section chief of the government-funded thinktank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), said the U.S. warplanes intentionally turned on their transponders so that their signals could be picked up by air movement trackers.In this way, it was sending a clear message tactically that it is closely watching the region despite the pandemic.These military movements might also be monitoring any moves made by their Chinese counterparts, he added.Lin Ying-yu (林穎佑), an assistant professor at National Chung Cheng University's Institute of Strategic and International Affairs, said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is apparently playing the ""anti-China/pro-Taiwan"" card by frequently sending warplanes and warships near Taiwan in the hope of gaining more voter support in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310023

3/31/2020,Taiwan's COVID-19 response could reach NT$1 trillion: premier,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The Taiwan government's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could reach as much as NT$1 trillion (US$33 billion), Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) told a legislative hearing on Tuesday.Such a figure would more adequately reflect the global nature of the crisis than the NT$60 billion special budget the Executive Yuan proposed in February, when the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was mainly limited to China, Su said.In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee De-wei (李德維) asked Su to detail the timing and scale of response measures being planned by the government, inquiring whether it would seek anything on the scale of Singapore's recently announced S$48 billion (US$33.65 billion) stimulus plan.""The overall scale will likely be around NT$1 trillion,"" Su said, arguing that the size of various countries' response measures will vary based on a variety of factors.In the United States, for example, people use private, rather than public insurance, while Taiwan uses the National Health Insurance program. Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003310025

5/7/2020,U.S. secretary of state urges WHO chief to invite Taiwan to WHA,"Washington, May 6 (CNA) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday called on the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA), saying it is within a WHO director-general's power to do so.In a press briefing, Pompeo reiterated Washington's support for Taipei's participation as an observer in this year's WHA, the decision-making body of the WHO, which will be held online from May 18-19 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.""Today I want to call upon all nations, including those in Europe, to support Taiwan's participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly and in other relevant United Nations venues,"" he said.He also urged WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to invite Taiwan to the WHA, ""as he has the power to do, and as his predecessors have done on multiple occasions.""Pompeo was referring to the fact that Tedros' predecessor, Margaret Chan (陳馮富珍), had sent invitations to Taiwan to observe the WHA from 2009 to 2016.Asked to comment if he will consider sending an invitation to Taiwan during a WHO press event held in Geneva that day, Tedros did not answer the question, referring it instead to WHO Legal Counsel Derek Walton.Walton reiterated the WHO's stance that the WHO secretariat has no authority to make such a decision unilaterally as it is to be made by all 194 member states.""The involvement, if any, of observers from 'Taiwan, China' in that assembly is a question for the 194 member governments, it's their decision,"" he noted.He also said that a number of member states have already raised proposals to discuss the matter at this year's WHA.He continued that whether or not Taiwan is invited to the assembly this year, there are ""well-established arrangements"" for health experts from ""Taiwan, China"" to work with the WHO on technical health matters.Taiwan participated in the WHA meetings from 2009 to 2016 as on observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei"" amid warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations under the then-Kuomintang (KMT) administration, which prioritized reducing cross-strait tension and building friendly ties with Beijing.Since 2017, however, China has persuaded the WHO not to invite Taiwan, in line with its hardline stance on cross-strait ties after President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office in May 2016.Explaining its decision for not sending invitations to Taiwan since 2017, the WHO said in 2019 that ""previous invitations to the WHA have been issued on the basis of a 'cross-strait understanding,'"" and that the ""absence of such an understanding"" in recent years has resulted in the fact that no more such invitations have been issued.According to the WHO Constitution, although the specialized agency under the U.N. does not recognize observer status, the rules of WHA procedure give the WHO director-general the right to invite observers to the annual WHA meeting, provided that they are ""States that have made application for membership, territories on whose behalf application for associate membership has been made, and States which have signed but not accepted the Constitution.""In response to Pompeo's remarks, Taiwan's foreign ministry on Thursday expressed gratitude, saying that it will continue to work closely with the U.S. and other like-minded countries in sharing Taiwan's success in containing the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The ministry also issued a protest over Walton's remarks that called the nation ""Taiwan, China,"" saying the designation belittled the nation's sovereignty.  (By Stacy Hsu, Tang Pei-chun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005070004

5/17/2020,Doyen of Taiwan's nativist literature movement passes away at 96,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) A doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement"" Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政) passed away at his home in Taoyuan City Saturday, according to his family. He was 96.Chung's son Chung Yen-wei (鍾延威) told reporters that the family found Chung not breathing around 7 p.m. Saturday.Chung Yen-wei said despite his father's old age, he was in relative stable health over the years. The family is deeply saddened and shocked by Chung's sudden passing and is now preparing his funeral.Born in Taoyuan's Longtan district in 1925 during Japanese rule, Chung was widely considered the doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement,"" who was most famous for his works, ""The Dull Ice Flower (魯冰花),"" ""the Turbid Waters Trilogy"" (濁流三部曲) and ""the Taiwanese Trilogy"" (台灣人三部曲).His classics of Taiwanese literature depicts the lives and fates of Taiwanese against the background of post-World War II Taiwan, following the end of the Japanese colonial period.In mourning the passing of Chung, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) expressed condolence to his family and said the passing of the nonagenarian literati is a great loss to the nation's literary circle.In a Facebook post, Tsai also praised Chung, an ethnic Hakka, for playing an import role in promoting Hakka culture and Taiwanese literature.Chung and other writers of his time had jointly published a regular newsletter in the post WWII era, the Literary Bulletin -- a periodical that proved essential to young and aspiring writers of that time, according to Tsai.Tsai said she will always remember Chung as an elder who saw her as his own child. She pledged to bear Chung's teaching in mind to continue the promotion of Hakka and Taiwanese culture so that Chung's legacy will last for generations to come.Asked to comment on Chung's legacy, writer Chen Fang-ming (陳芳明) told CNA that Chung had a tremendous impact toward the development of Taiwanese literature.Chung had played an crucial rule during the transitional period in the 1950s after the Kuomintang (KMT) had just taken over the governing of Taiwan from Japan at the end of Japanese colonial rule, according to Chen.Sincere condolences on the passing of #Hakka literary master Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政). The esteemed writer passed away on May 16 at the age of 96. https://t.co/zUbiiwwuCE pic.twitter.com/PH02BDFO0WAt that time, most Taiwanese could only speak Japanese and very few people could speak Mandarin, let alone write in the Chinese language. Chung was one of a handful of native Taiwanese writers of that time that can.Aside from focusing on his own works, Chung also published the Literary Bulletin that offered a platform for Taiwanese writers to publish their works.Chung's works had faithfully recorded the everyday lives of Taiwanese people of his time which showed his deep connection and affection toward his homeland, Chen noted.The Hakka Affairs Council, meanwhile, remembered Chung as not only a prolific writer but a devoted promoter of Hakka affairs who helped promote the awareness of Hakka culture to a national level, which successfully led to the creation in the 1990s of a dedicated Hakka language radio station.(By Chiu Chun-chin, Su Lung-chi Chen Ping-hung, Wu Hsin-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005170003

Taiwan will raise its retail gasoline and diesel prices by NT$0.9 per liter, effective midnight Sunday, the company said.After the increase, prices at CPC gas stations will be NT$19.1 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$20.6 per liter for 95 unleaded, NT$22.6 per liter for 98 unleaded, and NT$16.3 per liter for super diesel, CPC said.The latest price hikes came after international oil prices rose this past week because of the gradual stabilization of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world and news that Saudi Arabia would further cut oil production in June.CPC adjusts its fuel prices weekly based on changes in crude oil prices, using a weighted oil price formula composed of 70 percent Dubai crude and 30 percent Brent crude.Based on that formula, the price of crude rose US$3.36 over the past week from US$24.87 per barrel to US$28.23 per barrel, the company said.Meanwhile, CPC's main competitor, Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC), announced identical price hikes Sunday, to take effect at 1 a.m. Monday.After the adjustments, prices at FPCC gas stations will be NT$19.1 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$20.5 per liter for 95 octane unleaded, NT$22.6 per liter for 98 octane unleaded, and NT$16.1 per liter for diesel.(By Pan Tzu-yu and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005170004

The last time Taiwan recorded a domestic infection was on April 12.The lack of cases has led to a gradual loosening of restrictions that have been in place, and Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC, said at a daily briefing that special entertainment establishments could reopen under certain circumstances.The establishments, such as hostess KTVs and hostess dance clubs, would have to adopt social distancing guidelines, and customers and staff members would need to wear masks and have their temperatures checked and use hand sanitizer before entering the premise, Chen said.A system will also have to be in place that allows the businesses to reach customers after they have left, Chen said.""If the local governments can ensure these measures, then we can start re-opening these establishments,"" Chen said.Since the outbreak of COVID-19 late last year, Taiwan has recorded 440 cases, 349 of which have been classified as imported and 55 as local infections, according to CECC statistics.The other 36 cases are a cluster infection on a Navy vessel that returned April 9 from a Pacific goodwill mission. Those cases have not yet been classified as either local or imported, CECC data showed.To date, 395 COVID-19 patients in Taiwan have recovered, seven have died, with the remainder are still hospitalized, the CECC said in a statement.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 4,660,752 people in 187 countries and regions, including 1,489,642 in the United States, 272,043 in Russia, 240,161 in the United Kingdom, 230,698 in Spain and 224,760 in Italy, with a total of 311,064 fatalities, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.(By William Yen) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005170005

5/17/2020,Taiwan advised to work with major economies after COVID-19,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan must seize the opportunity to work with major economies seeking to relocate global supply chains outside of China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic scholars suggested as President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) begins her second term on May 20.The pandemic, which has made many countries aware of their growing economic dependence on China for goods in several critical sectors, has led to calls to delink global supply chains of major industries from China.That trend offers an extremely good opportunity to Taiwan, said Ray Yang (楊瑞臨), consulting director of the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center (ISTI) under the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).He said the United States, China and Europe may all look to develop independent production capabilities in the post-COVID-19 world, and Taiwan has an opportunity to become an important partner for all of them.Yang said the U.S. will still be the world leader but cannot go it alone and will itself have to form partnerships with economies such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Taiwan is well positioned, Yang said, because the COVID-19 crisis has opened the world's eyes to the strengths of Taiwanese businesses, including their ability to respond quickly to different situations, high degree of flexibility and quality of manufactured goods.That was seen most clearly in Taiwan's ramping up of production of face masks and protective gear for medical workers to meet high demand during the coronavirus epidemic, he said.Meanwhile, Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, predicted that the U.S. economy would recover faster from the coronavirus pandemic than China.That trend has already prompted more Taiwanese businesses operating overseas to increase investment in Taiwan and reduce investment in China and other countries, Chiu said.Chiu also contended it will be in Taiwan's interests if the United States create an alliance of ""trusted partners"" to restructure supply chains away from China, as has been reported.According to a Reuters report in early May, the alliance would apply common standards for everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to trade, education and commerce, with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, India and Vietnam among potential partners.Though Taiwan is not on the list of ""trusted partners,"" it is a reasonable assumption that Taiwan has an opportunity to be included in the next phase given that Taiwan is considered a partner in the U.S.'s ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,"" Chiu said.""We must let the United States know that Taiwan can make its planned supply chains more complete,"" Chiu said, pointing to Taiwan's semiconductor industry's advantage in wafer fabrication and packaging and testing technology, which would help build the U.S.'s IC design capabilities.Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises' strength in producing spare parts and component production could also strengthen those new supply chains, Chiu said.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wu Po-wei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005170008

5/17/2020,Rights group urges Taiwan to allow cross-national same-sex marriage,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) The Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) and several same-sex couples on Sunday urged Taiwan's government to allow same-sex marriages between couples from different countries.Taiwan's government legalized same-sex marriage in May 2019, becoming the first Asian country to do so.According to the Act Governing the Choice of Law in Civil Matters Involving Foreign Elements, however, a cross-national same-sex marriage can only be recognized in Taiwan if the countries of which the two partners are citizens both recognize same-sex marriage.The restriction discriminates against the LGBT community in Taiwan as marriage is a constitutional right, Pan Tien-ching (潘天慶), a lawyer from the TAPCPR, said at a press conference held near Taiwan's Presidential Office Building.Several cross-national same-sex couples lamented their difficult situations at the press conference.""For many cross-national same-sex couples, including me and my wife, our efforts to be with our loved ones are symbolized by our old plane ticket stubs,"" said Kaili Lai, a Taiwanese LGBT married to a Malaysian Tan Bee Guat.According to Lai, she and Tan held a simple wedding in Malaysia in 2016 with the blessings of their parents.Tan was not allowed to live in Taiwan, however because she was not a Taiwanese citizen and could not get a residence certificate because her marriage to Lai was not recognized.They had to fly frequently between Taiwan and Malaysia to see each other, leaving Tan little choice but to enroll in a university in Taiwan as a freshmen at the age of 35 to be able to stay in Taiwan on a student visa.But Tan is graduating next month and will have to enroll in a graduate school program to continue staying in Taiwan.Another cross-national same-sex couple, Joyce from Taiwan and Queenie from the Philippines, are facing the same predicament -- Queenie has to enroll in National Taiwan Normal University for the same purpose.According to the TAPCPR, the signature campaign it launched on May 9 to petition the government to amend laws that restrict same-sex marriage between such couples received 13,500 signatures and support from 20 human rights watchdogs in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Indonesia and the United States.The TAPCPR said it had written to relevant government units such as the Ministry of Justice, Mainland Affairs Council, National Immigration Agencies and the Ministry of Interiors on the issue.""Most government agencies have agreed that the issues need to be addressed but admitted that more coordination between relevant agencies is needed,"" the TAPCPR said as it urged President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to resolve the issue.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005170011

5/20/2020,Full text of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's second-term inaugural address,"Taipei, May 20 (CNA) The following is the full text of President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) inaugural address to start her second term, as released by the Presidential Office Wednesday:Vice President Lai, esteemed guests, friends watching on TV and online, my fellow citizens across the country, good morning.I feel immensely grateful to stand here once again today and take on the responsibility entrusted to me by the Taiwanese people.This inauguration ceremony is unique in the history of the Republic of China. What makes it special is not its size or the number of people in attendance. It is special because we know how difficult it has been for us to get to this point.I want to thank the people of Taiwan for making such a difficult feat possible.I particularly want to thank a group of people who have not received a lot of attention over the past four months in our fight against COVID-19. I want to thank every single person who waited in line outside of the pharmacy in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for trusting the government. You have shown the world Taiwan's commitment to civic virtues, even in times of greatest distress.I also want to thank everyone who was quarantined or isolated at home, putting up with inconvenience in your daily life to keep others safe and healthy. Thank you for exemplifying humanity's best qualities and helping us successfully bring the coronavirus outbreak under control.This sense of pride in our country, this community's shared destiny, and the memories of these past months will live on in all of our hearts. This is what solidarity feels like.Many ambassadors and representatives from other countries are here today, and I trust that many countries around the world are watching Taiwan as well.I want to take this opportunity to tell you that the country you see is populated by kind and resilient people. No matter the difficulties we face, we can always count on our democracy, our solidarity, and our sense of responsibility towards each other to help us overcome challenges, weather difficult times, and stand steadfast in the world.From January to now, Taiwan has amazed the international community twice. The first was our democratic elections, and the second was our success in the fight against COVID-19.In recent months, Taiwan's name has appeared in headlines around the world, thanks to our successful containment of the coronavirus outbreak.""Taiwan"" is also emblazoned on the boxes of supplies we are sending abroad. The Taiwanese people have the kindest hearts in the entire world, and we will always offer help to the international community whenever we are able.I hope that in addition to sharing in a sense of pride and joy, my fellow citizens can take to heart the spirit of ""helping ourselves to help others;"" ""when we help ourselves, others will help us.""This pandemic has not yet ended, and we must remain vigilant. Even when it ends, its impacts will linger on.The coronavirus has profoundly affected our world. It has changed the global political and economic order, accelerated and expanded the reorganization of global supply chains, restructured the global economy, and changed the way we live and shop. It has even changed the way the international community views Taiwan and developments in the surrounding region.These changes present us with both challenges and opportunities. I want to ask that my fellow citizens be prepared, because countless challenges and difficulties remain ahead of us.Over the next four years, only those who can end the pandemic within their borders, lay out a strategy for their country's survival and development, and take advantage of opportunities in the complex world of tomorrow, will be able to set themselves apart on the international stage.It takes more than fervor to govern a country. Leadership means calmly taking the right direction in a changing world. That is precisely what I have done over the past four years.I said before that I will leave you with a better country. So over the next four years, I will proactively develop our industries, foster a safe society, ensure national security, and deepen our democracy. I am going to reinvent Taiwan and lead our country into the future.1. Industrial and Economic DevelopmentI know that the Taiwanese people are most concerned about our industrial and economic development. In 2016, we initiated a new economic development model to help connect Taiwan's economy to the world. Over the past four years, despite massive changes in the international economy, Taiwan has done more than just weather the storm. Our economic growth has once again topped the Four Asian Tigers, and the stock market index now regularly breaks 10,000 points.Thanks to our successful control of the pandemic, so far, Taiwan is able to maintain positive economic growth. This is rare in the world. However, we need to continue to take early action on economic relief and revitalization, and do whatever it takes to maintain stable economic growth.Over the next four years, we will face more intense changes in the global economy and the accelerated reorganization of supply chains. We will continue to implement our Forward-looking Infrastructure Development and trillion NT-dollar investment programs. We will do so in the spirit of ""achieving growth through stability, and seizing opportunity amid changes,"" in order to secure Taiwan's economic development over the coming decades.In terms of industrial development, we are going to take advantage of the opportunities before us in six core strategic industries founded on our 5+2 Innovative Industries Program, to transform Taiwan into a critical force in the global economy.First, we will continue to develop our information and digital industries. We will take advantage of Taiwan's strengths in the semiconductor and ICT industries to secure a central role in global supply chains, and make Taiwan a major base for the development of next generation technologies, including IoT and AI.Second, we are going to develop a cybersecurity industry that can integrate with 5G, digital transformation, and our national security. We will strive to create cybersecurity systems and an industrial chain that can protect our country and earn the world's trust.Third, we are going to create biotech and medical technology industries integrated with the rest of the world. Throughout this pandemic, Taiwanese teams have proven that they are capable of working with world-class technologies to produce reagents and develop new drugs and vaccines. We are going to give these industries our utmost support, and transform Taiwan into a key force in the global battle against infectious diseases.Fourth, we are going to develop national defense and strategic industries by integrating military and civilian capabilities. In addition to domestically-produced naval vessel and aircraft programs that are currently underway, we will push harder to promote technological integration between the military and the private sector, to stimulate private sector production capabilities, and advance into the aviation and space industries.Fifth, we are going to accelerate the development of green energy and renewable energy industries. Over the past four years, renewable energy has experienced explosive growth, and Taiwan has become a hotspot for international investment. Building on this foundation, I am confident that we will achieve our goal of deriving 20% of our overall energy from green sources by 2025. We are going to make Taiwan a center for green energy in Asia.Sixth, we are going to establish strategic stockpile industries that can ensure the steady provision of critical supplies. Facing changes to the global order, we need to keep key industrial chains in Taiwan and maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the production of face masks, medical and daily supplies, energy, and food.In the current international climate, countries that end their dependence on others will have a head start on national development. I would like our friends across all industries to rest assured that our government stands with you. Over the next few years, we have several strategies to drive the growth of our industries.First, we will use domestic demand, particularly demand from the public sector and national security needs, as the basic engine for our industrial development.A prime example of this is the way strategic demand for face masks and other medical supplies throughout this pandemic has spurred the development of related industries. We can adopt a similar model for our national defense and renewable energy industries to help accelerate their development.We will continue to organize ""national teams,"" like our face mask team, according to the size and conditions of different industries. We will utilize our government's guarantee of domestic demand to establish a global strategic materials manufacturing industry under the ""Taiwanese brand"" and help it expand into other markets.We know that financial support is crucial to industrial development. Looking to the future, we will adopt more flexible financial policies, continue to reform financial systems, and use more diverse means to help industries obtain the financing they need.We will also work to create a safe environment for our industries. Our government is committed to maintaining sound public health and national security systems, a stable society, strong rule of law, and a healthy market. We need to offer these guarantees so that high-tech and strategic industries will be willing to choose Taiwan as their production and R&D base.We will also continue to guide the global expansion of our industries. We will keep working to sign trade or investment protection agreements with the United States, Japan, and European countries.As we continue to promote our New Southbound Policy, we will also develop other potential markets and encourage firms to establish operations there, giving our industries an edge when they engage in international cooperation. Overseas Taiwanese business communities around the world will be our best partners as we seek new international opportunities.Finally, we have the issue of talent. In order for Taiwan to become a key global economic force, we need a diverse talent pool. My government will bring in the world's top technical, R&D, and management talents to help globalize Taiwan's workforce, widen our industries' horizons, and give them the ability to compete in the international arena.Looking to the future, Taiwan must further connect with the international community. We will work to cultivate more outstanding bilingual and digital talents, giving our industries a global competitive edge.Over the next four years, Taiwan's economy will enter a new stage, complete with more flexible capital and talent flows, more robust industrial capabilities, and closer ties with the world. Together, we are going to enter a new era of shared prosperity.2. Safe Society: Health and Social Safety Nets to Catch Those Who Need HelpAs we develop our industries, we will also keep in mind that the people expect the government to foster a safe society. To be a better country, the government must take on more responsibilities to reduce the burden on the people and mitigate issues in society.Over the past few years, we have addressed Long-term Care 2.0, childcare, and residential justice issues. Over the next four years, my goal is to weave an even tighter net that can catch every single person who needs help and prevent future tragedies.●Health and Disease Prevention Safety NetFirst, we will strengthen our health and disease prevention safety net. Taiwan is an ageing society, and infectious diseases pose a serious challenge to the health of our people. That is why we need to bolster our disease prevention and treatment capabilities and link industries to make more breakthroughs in vaccine and new drug development, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, so that people can enjoy healthy lives and receive better care.●Mending Gaps in the Social Safety NetOur second step will be to mend the gaps in our social safety net. Over the past few years, a great deal of discussion has arisen around public safety incidents involving schizophrenia patients. The same goes for other mental illnesses, drug addiction, and domestic violence.I understand your concerns. These issues are not just the responsibility of individuals or families, they are the responsibility of the government. When families are unable to provide proper care, the government has a duty to step in and help.I am going to upgrade our social care system, enhance the capabilities of frontline social workers, and improve their work environments, so that they can work at the grassroots and identify people who have fallen through the gaps in our safety net.We cannot hold medical agencies or individual judges solely responsible for controversies surrounding specific cases. Our judicial and executive branches should reevaluate and optimize these systems and take initiatives to make any necessary legal amendments.3. National Security: National Defense Reforms, Active International Participation, Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsA better country requires a greater emphasis on national security. Over the past four years, we have pushed for national defense reforms, active international participation, and peaceful, stable cross-strait relations. We hope that Taiwan can play a more active role in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Over the next four years, the direction of our policies will remain the same, and we will do even more.●National Defense ReformsWe have three important directions for our national defense reforms. First is accelerating the development of our asymmetrical capabilities. While we work to bolster our defense capabilities, future combat capacity development will also emphasize mobility, countermeasures, and non-traditional asymmetrical capabilities. We will also work to strengthen our defenses against the threats of cyber warfare, cognitive warfare, and ""unrestricted"" warfare to achieve our strategic goal of multidomain deterrence.The second is substantive reforms to our military reserve and mobilization systems. We need to enhance the quality of our reserve forces, as well as their weapons, equipment, and training, in order to achieve effective jointness with our regular forces. We also need to establish a standing, interdepartmental system connecting our reserve and mobilization systems. This system will help coordinate personnel and supplies, so that we can successfully mobilize during a transition from peacetime to war.Third is improvements to our military's management institutions. Today's young servicemembers have all grown up in a democratic society, and one of our most important missions will be to find ways for them to better utilize their professional skills in line with military needs.Some young servicemembers have difficulties adjusting to military needs, reflecting the gap between today's society and our military management institutions. We need to work to close that gap. We need to reduce negative societal views of the military and end the gradual erosion of our military's prestige and morale due to individual incidents caused by imperfect institutions.Thus, we will improve appeal and counseling mechanisms within the military, establish a fair and equitable incident investigation mechanism, and regularly evaluate personnel placements. In terms of education and training, we will strengthen leadership capacities across all levels of leadership and foster a modern management system that emphasizes professionalism.We need to strike a balance between the team-oriented military discipline needed for actual combat and society's respect for the individual.●Active International ParticipationOver the past four years, we have actively taken part in addressing major global issues, including counter-terrorism cooperation, humanitarian assistance, religious freedom, and nontraditional security.Throughout this global pandemic, we have been praised for providing selfless assistance to the international community wherever we are able.Taiwan has been deemed a democratic success story, a reliable partner, and a force for good in the world by the international community. All Taiwanese people should take pride in this.Over the next four years, we will continue to fight for our participation in international organizations, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with our allies, and bolster ties with the United States, Japan, Europe, and other like-minded countries.We will also participate more actively in regional cooperation mechanisms and work hand-in-hand with countries in the region to make concrete contributions to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.●Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsIn the face of complex and changing cross-strait circumstances, we have made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait over the past four years, gaining approval from the international community. We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security.Here, I want to reiterate the words ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue."" We will not accept the Beijing authorities' use of ""one country, two systems"" to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle.We will continue to handle cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. This has been our consistent position for maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Cross-strait relations have reached a historical turning point. Both sides have a duty to find a way to coexist over the long term and prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences. Faced with changing circumstances, I will hold firm to my principles, adopt an open attitude to resolve issues, and shoulder my responsibilities as President. I also hope that the leader on the other side of the Strait will take on the same responsibility, and work with us to jointly stabilize the long-term development of cross-strait relations.While we work to achieve national development, it is crucial that we optimize our government institutions over the next four years. Our Legislative Yuan will establish a constitutional amendment committee, giving us a platform to engage in dialogue and reach a consensus on constitutional reforms pertaining to government systems and people's rights.This democratic process will enable the constitutional system to progress with the times and align with the values of Taiwanese society. Our first priority should be to lower the voting age from 20 to 18, an issue on which both the majority and opposition parties are in agreement.In terms of judicial reform, I delivered on my promise to convene a National Congress on Judicial Reform, and we completed amendments to the Judges Act, the Attorney Regulation Act, the Constitutional Court Procedure Act, and the Labor Incident Act. This is all base work for the further improvement of our judicial system.However, our judicial reforms are still in transition, and our current progress has not yet met the public's expectations. I will continue to solicit opinions from across society and keep pressing forward. The people's dissatisfaction drives us to continue on the path of reform.Within the next four years, we need to implement a lay judge system, so that citizens can act as lay judges in court and become catalysts for judicial reform. This will help bridge the distance between the people and our judicial system, so that it aligns better with their expectations and earns their trust.All constitutional institutions must also continue on the path of reform. The Executive Yuan will reevaluate and reinitiate its organizational reform process, including the establishment of a specialized digital development agency and adjustments to all ministries in line with current needs. This will enable governance capabilities to be more responsive to the needs of national development.The National Human Rights Commission under the Control Yuan will officially be established in August of this year. This will be a milestone in our journey to place human rights at the center of Taiwan's national ethos, and marks the start of a new chapter for the Control Yuan.Our new Examination Yuan team will be instated in September, and I will ask them to propose a comprehensive reform plan and evaluate past policies, so that they can become an effective human resource department that can cultivate the talent a modern government needs.My fellow citizens, over the past 70 years, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has grown more resilient and unified through countless challenges. We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation. We have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Although we were once isolated in the world, we have always persisted in the values of democracy and freedom, no matter the challenges ahead of us. We will always remain committed to our common belief: Taiwan must help ourselves to help others, and when we help ourselves, others will help us.Many of the heroes in our fight against COVID-19 are here with us today, including members of our national face mask team, our Central Epidemic Command Center's public health team, and Premier Su Tseng-chang's team.There are many more heroes from all walks of life not in attendance today: medical workers, postal workers, pharmacists, convenience store clerks, taxi drivers, and many more.I may not be able to call out all of your names, but I want everyone to know that Taiwan has overcome countless challenges over the past 70 years, relying on not just one or two heroes, but thanks to countless heroes such as yourselves, working together to turn the wheels of history. You have helped make Taiwan a happy, safe, and prosperous place for generations to come.I want to express my respect to all of you. Every single person in Taiwan is a hero. Vice President Lai and I are honored to take on the responsibility you have entrusted to us.Taking on the responsibility of the President of the Republic of China in such difficult times brings me more pressure than joy. But I will not back down, because all of you are with me.The path forward will not be easy, and greater challenges await us. But we are a country that has persevered through even the greatest hardships. We, the 23 million people, have always been and will always be a community with a shared destiny.I truly hope that all of my fellow citizens will remember how it felt to come together to overcome the challenges of the past few months. The Republic of China can be united. Taiwan can be safe. Being Taiwanese can be an honor that makes you hold your head high.My dear citizens, the path ahead of us is long, and we are about to begin a new chapter in Taiwan's story. Taiwan's story belongs to each and every one of us, and it needs each and every one of us.I ask that the 23 million people of Taiwan act as our guides and partners. Let us pool our wisdom and courage and make this country a better place together. Thank you.（For the full text in Mandarin: 最特別的就職典禮 蔡總統：感謝台灣人民【演說全文】）",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005200003

5/22/2020,National event planned for Taiwanese athletes in August,"Taipei, May 22 (CNA) A national competitive sports event is planned for early August, so Taiwanese athletes originally scheduled to participate in the Tokyo Olympics this summer can review their fitness and make revisions to training programs if necessary, the Sports Administration head said Thursday.A total of 12 disciplines will be featured in the event scheduled from Aug. 1-8 at the National Sports Training Center in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung, said Sports Administration Director-General Kao Chin-hsung (高俊雄).The disciplines announced by Kao include athletics, swimming, archery, boxing, karate, gymnastics, table tennis, badminton, weight-lifting, taekwondo, judo, and shooting.The event is planned so athletes can determine whether their training remains on track, according to Kao.A schedule designed to pit athletes at similar levels against each other, will be unveiled in mid-June, Kao said.The events will be behind closed doors with no spectators, while arrangements will be made with media outlets to broadcast the event.In late March, the International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee announced the postponement of the Summer Games, which will now be held July 23 to Aug. 8, 2021, due to concerns about athletes' health amid the COVID-19 conoravirus pandemic.(By Huang Chiao-wen and Kay Liu) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005220008
5/22/2020,A new 'internet for everything' era on the way: expert,"By Kay Liu, CNA staff writerThe global COVID-19 pandemic has upended people's lives, giving terms such as stay at home, work from home, and social distancing added resonance and accentuating the importance of the internet in connecting with others and doing one's job.What many are wondering is if these lifestyle changes will become entrenched and workplaces permanently altered even as the pandemic eases and people can move freely again.Kenny Huang, the chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), says the trends are here to stay, and he foresees a world of ""internet for everything,"" in which even more tasks will be done online.""Before the pandemic, the internet was an information technology tool. For businesses, it was used to help with operations, marketing or other areas. But in the post-COVID-19 era, all business activities will likely be connected to the internet,"" Huang said in a recent interview with CNA.Huang is in as good a position as anybody to look into the future of cyberspace.His TWNIC, which manages domain names ending with .tw and internet protocol (IP) addresses in Taiwan, routinely conducts surveys and issues reports on internet use that offer insights into trends and developments in the online world and help businesses make decisions.He believes COVID-19 has already made the internet part of a new reality because people no longer feel that things have to be done face-to-face, at least judging by the surge in online traffic and bandwidth he has observed from Dec. 30, 2019 to March 23.Huang estimates that the internet is used in about 10 percent of everyday work at present, but he expects that to go much higher in the future as habits change.Possible risksThe increasingly internet-dependent world that Huang envisions could have a downside, however, with risks that already exist such as threats to cybersecurity or the monopolization of information potentially magnified, he said.He pointed to the possibility of a wider spread of disinformation if people become more reliant on digital media as a news source.""There are always new solutions, but there will always be new types of disruptions,"" said Huang, who used the example of fake news evolving from pure fiction to mixing in some facts to create misinformation.The new solutions, he said, are the likes of the review mechanism introduced by Facebook and Twitter and the work of organizations such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center.Social mediaSocial media could also fall prey to the growing importance of the internet, Huang suggested.At its core, the internet is about transmitting data and connecting devices, while social media plays the role of ""connecting people, who share and exchange the knowledge and views they have,"" he said.Interactions online may mirror those in the real world, but they are not perfect reflections, he said.They could become even more imperfect as reliance on the internet means users gravitate to only a few major service providers, and those platforms' user agreement and rules become, in effect, the rules of society, Huang cautioned.According to the center's annual Taiwan Internet Report for 2019, 79.2 percent of those surveyed between September and November last year used online social media, of whom 98.9 percent used Facebook, 38.8 percent used Instagram and only 5.6 percent used Twitter.Security concernsBehind the changing of habits seen during the global pandemic, the introduction of fifth generation wireless technology (5G) could also profoundly affect user habits by offering accessible, fast internet access at an affordable price.But its arrival has posed a challenge to Taiwan's government that may dominate the debate over cyberspace in the post-COVID-19 world -- balancing an open ecosystem with security concerns.In terms of 5G, the existing internet environment could make it easy for just a few companies to become dominant players, and they may be foreign and even hostile to Taiwan's interests. That has led Taiwan's government to intervene in the 5G arena by banning the use of essential equipment from certain suppliers or countries, especially China, on the grounds of national security, Huang said.Such fears have extended into other areas, including to internet services, he said, citing the example of China-based video-conferencing service Zoom, which has soared in popularity during the pandemic but was banned in Taiwan for government and school use over security concerns.Yet the government has not been as interventionist in other social or commercial domains, Huang said, citing the example of the growing popularity of foreign online streaming services that are full of content from China.The TWNIC report found that 84.5 percent of those surveyed watched online video or streamed content, 76.3 percent of which was produced in Taiwan, followed by China (42.2 percent), the United States (38.2 percent), Japan (35.2 percent), South Korea (34.4 percent) and Europe (13.2 percent).Striking a balance between free speech and China's attempts to use cultural power to spread its message in Taiwan will not be easy for the government, Huang said.Personal protectionMeanwhile, Huang warned that we all, at some level, will have to be prepared for the pitfalls of being heavily reliant on the online world.Shutdowns of service ""have happened and could still happen, and the impact on us will only increase because the time we spend and our reliance on internet services is growing,"" he said.""When using online services, people need to think ahead and have a plan B in case a company shuts down operations. Everyone should back up data routinely, update online accounts, update passwords, and not allow cookies when browsing online when they are not necessary,"" he advised.Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005220009

5/22/2020,Global support for Taiwan at record high: former U.S. official,"Washington, May 21 (CNA) Randall G. Schriver, a former United States assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said Thursday that Taiwan has won huge global support because of its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, despite China's suppression.""Taiwan's international recognition, international admiration for Taiwan, international support for Taiwan has almost never been higher, because we see the juxtaposition of how the PRC has handled the coronavirus and how Taiwan has,"" Schriver said at a virtual conference hosted by the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.Schriver also berated China for poaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies and seeking to exclude Taiwan from global bodies like the World Health Organization.The Communist Party of China's ""approach to Taiwan has failed, not by my measure but by their own measure,"" he said in the forum, titled U.S.-Taiwan Relations and Taiwan's Evolving Role in the Global Order.As a result of China's failed policies, it has destroyed any pathway for what it calls peaceful reunification and any remaining constituency for a future ""one China,"" Schriver said.China's proposed 'one country, two systems' unification framework ""never had much of a constituency in Taiwan, but polls now regarding what aspirations people have for a future arrangement ... have never been worse from China's perspective,"" he said. ""So it is very difficult to see re-sinification of Taiwan through peaceful means.""In light of that situation, Schriver said, the U.S. should be concerned about a growing temptation on the part of China to use more military tools and coercion against Taiwan.Under such circumstances, the U.S. and Taiwan should strengthen cooperation in the field of information sharing, he said, adding that he supports U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to help boost its defense capability.Also at the forum, Evan Medeiros, Penner Family chair in Asian studies and the Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations, said it is becoming more difficult for the U.S. to strike a balance in supporting Taiwan while seeking to build a constructive relationship with China, given that China is growing more confident in East Asia, and Taiwan is facing increasing pressure and coercion from Beijing.Medeiros said the U.S. should take its security pledge to Taiwan seriously, sell Taiwan more weapons based on the Taiwan Relations Act, and help Taiwan join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Chin-yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005220011
5/22/2020,"Government, opposition condemn China plans for new HK security laws","Taipei, May 22 (CNA) Taiwan's government and leading opposition party spoke out Friday against plans by the Chinese government to enact new national security laws in Hong Kong.At a press conference Thursday, Chinese officials announced that the National People's Congress, China's Legislature, would review a bill ""on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard national security.""While the text of the legislation has yet to be released, Chinese state media signaled that it will provide legal grounds for the central government to intervene against activities in Hong Kong it deems subversive to state power.In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday that the proposed legislation demonstrates the Chinese government's inability to reflect on the true causes of dissatisfaction in Hong Kong, as it instead seeks to blame its problems on foreign interference and independence activists.Alex Huang (黃重諺), a spokesperson for Taiwan's Presidential Office, called on Beijing to respect Hong Kongers' legitimate democratic aspirations and to enter into dialogue with them, rather than further restricting their freedoms.Both of Taiwan's major political parties also issued statements condemning the legislation.Hung Yu-chien (洪于茜), a spokesperson for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said Taiwanese people across party lines are concerned about the situation in Hong Kong and called on Beijing to respect the region's autonomy.The proposed legislation will bypass Hong Kong's Legislature and violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration's guarantee of autonomy for the region, Hung went on, adding that Hong Kong people's distrust of Beijing, which led to major protest movements in 2014 and 2019, would only be exacerbated by the plans.As far as the KMT is concerned, the Republic of China (Taiwan's formal name) is a sovereign country, and the ""one country, two systems"" model espoused by China is absolutely not on the table, Hung said.The governing Democratic Progressive Party, meanwhile, said the plans made it possible that anyone in Hong Kong could end up as the next Lee Ming-che (李明哲), and ""declared again to the world that 'one country, two systems' is dead.""Lee, a Taiwanese pro-democracy activist, disappeared in March 2017 after entering China from Macau and was subsequently jailed for ""subverting state power.""In an opening address to the People's Congress on Friday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克强) said the country would continue to oppose Taiwan independence and promote reunification with China.(By Yu Hsiang, Wen Kuei-hsiang and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005220012

3/2/2020,Taiwanese seeking jobs in Philippine gambling sector urged to be cautious,"Taipei, March 1 (CNA) The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) on Sunday advised Taiwanese applying for work in the Philippines gambling industry to exercise caution, saying many companies in that sector are operating outside the law.In a press release, the CIB said gambling in the Philippines is legal only within designated areas, and many companies running that kind of business do not have the required government permits.Many Taiwanese employees in illegal online gambling businesses in the Philippines become embroiled in disputes over pay and suffer physical abuse, while some are abducted and their families are asked to pay a ransom for their release, the CIB said.The CIB said that in the first two months of the year, its liaison officer in Manila, in cooperation with Philippine law enforcement, rescued three Taiwanese employees in the gambling business who had been abducted.The figures for such cases were 12 in 2019 and 11 in 2018, the CIB said, adding that in some cases, the Taiwanese employees had fallen victim to loan sharks.People, therefore, are warned to be cautious when seeking jobs in the gambling business in the Philippines, the CIB said, citing the recent case of a Taiwanese being allegedly abducted and beaten after he got into a dispute with the illegal gambling company at which he was employed.The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in the Philippines received a call from the Taiwanese employee, appealing for help and saying also that his salary was being withheld, according to the CIB.Potential Taiwanese employees should carefully check the background of gambling enterprises in the Philippines before accepting jobs and should make sure they understand the terms of the work contracts, the CIB said.Those who do accept jobs in the gambling industry should ensure that when they arrive in the Philippines, the company would process their work visas, permits and other required documents, the CID advised.(By Huang Li-yun and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003020003
3/2/2020,Taichung company reopens after 2-week closure due to COVID-19 scare,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) A woodworking company in Taichung resumed work Monday after a two-week shutdown that was spurred by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and death in the family of one of its employees.All 58 of the company's employees were sent on leave and instructed to remain in home quarantine from Feb. 17 to March 1.After the two week period, the employees all tested negative for the COVID-19, and the company was allowed to resume operations on Monday, the Taichung Health Bureau said.The shutdown was spurred by the infection and subsequent death of a 61-year old private driver, Taiwan's 19th coronavirus case and first death, who was a relative of one of the company's employees.Before the man died on Feb. 16, he had infected four relatives during a family gathering on Jan. 27 -- his mother, sister and brother, and the husband of his niece.The woodworking company in the city's Tanzi District said Monday that its premises have been thoroughly disinfected and its employees will receive full pay for the two weeks they were in home quarantine.Meanwhile, a food processing factory in Taichung, at which the sister of the 19th patient was employed, also resumed work on Monday but said some of its workers were still in home quarantine.(By Hao Hsueh-chin, Chao Li-yen, Su Mu-chun and Ko Lin) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003020004

3/4/2020,TSMC teams up with Broadcom in 5nm process development,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has joined forces with U.S.-based integrated circuit designer Broadcom Inc. in advanced 5 nanometer process development.In a statement released Tuesday, TSMC said it has teamed up with Broadcom to strengthen the Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) integrated circuit packaging platform that supports 5nm technology.According to TSMC, CoWoS provides best-in-breed performance and highest integration density for high performance computing applications, and the particular wafer level system integration platform offers a wide range of interposer sizes, a number of high bandwidth memory (HBM) cubes, and package sizes.The cooperation with Broadcom means TSMC will provide one-stop services from IC packaging to pure wafer foundry services to Broadcom, which has come on board with other foreign tech giants such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Huawei Technolgies Inc., to use the Taiwanese chipmaker's 5nm process technology.In addition to contract chip production, TSMC has started high-end IC packaging operations in a bid to provide its customers with a wide range of comprehensive services.The 7 nanometer process is the latest technology the chipmaker has begun mass producing, while the company is also developing the more sophisticated 5mn and 3mn processes.TSMC is scheduled to launch mass production of the 5nm process in the first half of this year. The 3nm process is expected to begin commercial production in 2022.Through its partnership with Broadcom, TSMC's next generation CoWoS packaging services provide bandwidth of up to 2.7 terabytes per second, which is 2.7 times faster than the CoWoS solution the chipmaker previously offered in 2016.TSMC said with higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the CoWoS solution jointly developed with Broadcom is well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as deep learning, workloads for 5G networking and power-efficient data centers.At an investor conference held in mid-January, TSMC said the company expects to benefit from solid demand for smartphones, high performance computer (HPC) devices, Internet of Things related applications and automotive electronics this year.Amid optimism over global demand, TSMC has devoted itself to high-end technology development, a move expected to boost its global competitive edge and sustain the company's lead over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., which has started advanced technology processes with an eye to gaining a larger share of the global market.For the development of its high-end processes, TSMC has said capital expenditure for 2020 is expected to range from US$15-16 billion, the highest level in the company's history.Currently, TSMC has more than 50 percent of the global pure wafer foundry market.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003040004

3/6/2020,Taiwan shares plunge on U.S. market volatility,"Taipei, March 6 (CNA) Taiwan shares moved sharply lower Friday morning after the U.S. markets plunged overnight on growing fears over the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States, dealers said.Investors scrambled to dump large cap stocks across the board, with the downturn led by tech heavyweights, such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, they said.As of 10:58 a.m., the benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) or the Taiex, had fallen 169.29 points, or 1.47 percent, to 11,345.53 on turnover of NT$85.07 billion (US$2.84 billion).""The market was battered by panic selling soon after it opened, as investors saw an almost 1,000 point dive on the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight,"" Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su said. The Dow plunged 3.58 percent Thursday.""Market sentiment here was moved by a soaring VIX on the U.S. markets as investors at home and abroad feared the COVID-19 spread in the U.S., the largest economy in the world, will further affect the global economy.""The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX), which is widely considered an ideal gauge of fear in the market, soared about 14 percent overnight.The spread of the COVID-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has undermined production in China and interrupted global supply chains. The contagion could also hurt private consumption in the U.S.Since the novel coronavirus first emerged at the end of December, more than 96,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with infections in more than 80 countries and territories and more than 3,300 deaths, the majority of which have been in China.""Such unfavorable circumstances are expected to pose threats to Taiwan's export-oriented economy,"" Su said.It was no surprise that Friday's selling in Taiwan focused on the bellwether electronics sector, which depends heavily on global demand, Su said.As of 10:58 a.m., TSMC had lost 2.01 percent to NT$316.50 with 25.07 million shares changing hands after its American depositary receipts (ADRs) lost 2.37 percent on U.S. markets overnight.Led by TSMC, the electronics sector was down 1.43 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index was down 1.76 percent.Also in the high tech sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had lost 1.93 percent to NT$81.10, while Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., was little changed at NT$4,600.00.Following a 1.45 percent fall in its ADRs overnight, integrated circuit packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. had lost 2.99 percent to NT$71.40, while IC designer MediaTek Inc. had lost 1.17 percent to NT$380.50.Selling was also seen among large cap old economy stocks with Formosa Plastics Corp. down 1.61 percent at NT$91.80 and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 2.15 percent at NT$68.20.In the financial sector, Fubon Financial Holding Co. had fallen 1.88 percent to NT$44.30, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. had lost 1.37 percent to NT$39.60.""The silver lining was that the magnitude of the fall in the local market was not as heavy as elsewhere in the world as the TWSE remained awash in liquidity and many investors appeared willing to park their money here,"" Su said.""I expect the Taiex will see strong support at around the 240-day moving average of 11,049 points,"" Su said.

3/13/2020,Stabilization fund ready to shore up equity market: MOF,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Finance Minister Su Jain-rong (蘇建榮) on Friday said the National Financial Stabilization Fund is ready to lend support to the local equity market and its committee could meet at anytime if necessary, amid global volatility spurred by escalating fears over the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 worldwide.At a news conference held at around 8:15 a.m., 45 minutes before the local equity market opened, Su urged investors to remain confident in Taiwan's economic fundamentals, saying the Ministry of Finance, the central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission will come up with measures to stabilize the stock market.Su made the comments as concerns over the spread of COVID-19 intensfied, sending ripples through global financial markets.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,352 points or almost 10 percent, the largest single session drop since Oct. 19, 1987, when the index shed 22.6 percent amid a global financial crisis, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index also dropped more than 9 percent even though the U.S. Federal Reserve took the unusual step of injecting funds into the market.Despite Su's remarks, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or the Taiex still opened down 331.29 points at 10,091.03 and the weakness continued on panic-led selling across the board.Su said the stabilization fund is watching the local equity market closely and its committee could meet anytime, if necessary, and jump into the market to counter the impact of global volatility.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.The fund intervenes in the market when it receives authorization from the fund committee, which is currently managed by Vice Finance Minister Juan Ching-hwa (阮清華), who is executive secretary of the fund.However, Su said with the virus, originally from the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading worldwide, it is no surprise that the global economy faces severe challenges with plunging equity markets around the world.In addition to the dive on the U.S. markets, the equity markets in France, Germany and the United Kingdom also tumbled 12.28 percent, 12.24 percent and 10.87 percent, respectively, Thursday.Compared with the markets in the U.S. and Europe, Juan said, Taiwanese equities appear resilient despite the ongoing scare over the virus. He cited data from Feb. 24 to March 12, showing that the Taiex fell 10.82 percent, while the Dow dropped 26.88 percent, and the markets in France, Germany and the U.K. shed 32.93 percent, 32.54 percent and 29.26 percent, respectively.The relatively small drop in Taiwan came as the country has executed efficient and effective measures to contain the spread of the virus, Juan said, adding that healthy economic fundamentals and attractive dividend yields in the equity market have enabled Taiwanese stocks to fend off unfavorable external factors to some extent.""It is unnecessary for investors to panic,"" Juan said, ""They should have faith in the local equity market.""(By Wu Chia-jung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003130003

""The local equity market has been battered by external factors instead of fundamental problems for the moment and it is too early to say when the market will stage a meaningful technical rebound despite some bargain hunting.""Among the falling tech heavyweights, TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock on the local market, had shed 3.91 percent at NT$282.50 after hitting a low of NT$272.50, with 85.16 million shares changing hands.""I think TSMC and other large cap stocks have been supported by government-led funds in a bid to prevent the Taiex from falling further and to bolster market confidence,"" Tang said.The stabilization fund will enter the market only if the fund's committee meets and issues an order for intervention.The NT$500 billion stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors disrupting the local bourse.Also in the electronics sector, which had fallen 5.38 percent as of 11:56 a.m., iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, had shed 4.02 percent at NT$71.70, but came off a low of NT$69.90 on bargain hunting.When Hon Hai shares fell to NT$69.90, the stock's market cap fell below the NT$1 trillion level reaching NT$969 billion as investors took their cue from recent sell-offs of the stock by foreign institutional investors, which registered net sales of 88.26 million shares in the previous five sessions, dealers said.Terry Gou (郭台銘), founder of Hon Hai, told reporters on Thursday that progress in reopening the company's sprawling production sites in China after the Lunar New Year holiday is ahead of schedule.Hon Hai is one of the largest investors in China with a workforce of more than 1 million.Last week, Hon Hai Chairman Liu Young-way (劉揚偉) said production at the company's factories has met more than 50 percent of demand in the current quarter, a traditionally slow season for the electronics industry, since production resumed after the holiday.Bargain hunters also bought into integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc., which had lost 3.13 percent at NT$325.50 after hitting a low of NT$305.50, as of 11:56 a.m., while shares in Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc. had fallen 2.76 percent at NT$3,890.00, off an early low of NT$3,620.00.In the petrochemical sector, which was hit by falling international crude oil prices, down 7.48 percent, Formosa Plastics Corp. had lost 6.90 percent at NT$78.20, Nan Ya Plastics Corp. had fallen 7.99 percent to NT$58.70, and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. shed 8.82 percent at NT$70.30.""Unless the global virus contagion shows signs of easing, global volatility could continue and it is hard to say where the Taiex can find strong technical support anytime soon,"" Tang said.(By Chung Jung-feng, Pan Yi-ching and Frances Huang) Enditem",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003130006

3/28/2020,Extreme heavy rain alert issued for Taitung,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) An extreme heavy rain alert has been issued for Taitung County in southeastern Taiwan on Saturday due to the effects of a weather front, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).The CWB said precipitation on Orchid Island of Taitung is expected to become apparent and will continue into Saturday afternoon due to the weather front, warning people living in low-lying areas of floodwaters.The bureau has lifted a heavy rain warning it had previously imposed earlier Saturday for the areas south of Taoyuan City as the weather front is passing, but it warned of possible occasional heavy rainfall in northern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula in the south.Under the bureau's definition, heavy rain means accumulated rainfall of 80 millimeters or more within a 24-hour period or rainfall of 40 mm or more in an hour, while extreme heavy rain is defined as accumulated rainfall of 200 mm or more within 24 hours.Along with the rainfall brought by the weather front, an accelerating northeasterly wind system is expected to cool northern Taiwan down as temperature highs are forecast to fall to 21-24 degrees Celsius Saturday from about 30 degrees a day earlier.Daytime temperatures in central and southern Taiwan are expected to fall in a moderate pace to 27-28 and 29-30 degrees, respectively, on Saturday, from 31-32 degrees a day earlier, the CWB said.With the weather front intensifying, the CWB said, the mercury around Taiwan will fall further from Saturday night through early Sunday morning.The bureau forecast temperatures will dip to 15 degrees in northern Taiwan, 16-17 degrees in central Taiwan and 18-19 degrees in the south on Sunday.It urged the public to keep a close eye on a wide day-night temperature gap, in particular in central and southern Taiwan, and to stay warm.In addition, the CWB said, the wind system is also expected to bring in strong winds for the areas north of Tainan, eastern Taiwan including Orchid Island and Green Island, the Hengchun Peninsula, as well as the outlying Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands Saturday.Such low temperatures are expected to continue into Sunday but drier weather is likely, with only sporadic showers expected in northeastern Taiwan and the mountainous areas in the north, the CWB said.Meanwhile, air quality in the north as well as Yilan, Hualien and Taitung in eastern Taiwan and the outlying Matsu and Penghu islands were rated ""good"" on Saturday, while it was ""fair"" in central Taiwan, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south, as well as Kinmen, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said.(By Chen Chun-shuo and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003280001

3/28/2020,U.S. reportedly eyes curb of TSMC's supply to Huawei,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) The United States has been aiming to curb the supply of chips sold by contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to China's Huawei Technologies Co. through planned heavier sanctions against the Chinese telecom equipment giant, according to a Reuters report.The report said while tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating with both sides blaming each other for spreading the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Trump administration has a plan to introduce new measures to further restrict global chip sales to Huawei.Under the proposed new rules, the report, dated Thursday in Washington, said foreign companies that use U.S. production equipment to roll out their chips would be required to obtain a U.S. license ahead of sales of certain chips to Huawei, which was blacklisted last year.Citing unnamed sources, the report said the measures are aimed at curbing supplies of chips to Huawei's integrated circuit design subsidiary arm HiSilicon Technologies Co. from TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.The report said it remained unknown whether President Donald Trump will approve the new sanction measures since he appeared to oppose the measures in February. If the new measures are imposed, Huawei and TSMC, as well as American enterprises, will feel the pinch, it said.The report quoted a research paper written by China-based Everbright Securities last year as saying most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials.""This is going to have a far more negative impact on U.S. companies than it will on Huawei, because Huawei will develop their own supply chain,"" trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said in the report. ""Ultimately, Huawei will find alternatives.""In Taipei, TSMC said it was unable to respond to any ""hypothetical questions"" and would not comment on any individual clients.According to a market estimate, Huawei accounts for about 10 percent of TSMC's total sales. Market analysts said if the strict rules are imposed, TSMC will see its shipments squeezed.After the possible heavier sanctions against Huawei surfaced, shares of TSMC gave up earlier gains of 2.14 percent on the Friday trading session in Taipei, falling 2.50 percent to close at NT$273.00 (US$9.03) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index also came off an earlier high of 9,954.86 points, down 0.38 percent to end at 9,698.92.On Friday, foreign institutional investors sold a net 5.23 million TSMC shares, stopping a three-day streak of a net buy, but for the entire week, such investors recorded a net buy of 28.47 million TSMC shares.TSMC's American depositary receipts on the U.S. market also fell 5.94 percent overnight as the market came under pressure amid fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.(By Emmanuelle Tseng, Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003280003

3/31/2020,All 214 evacuees from Hubei placed in quarantine,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The 214 Taiwanese nationals who returned to Taiwan on Monday night after being stranded in Hubei province by the new coronavirus outbreak have been placed in quarantine and will soon be tested for COVID-19.The passengers were taken by about a dozen tour buses to an undisclosed quarantine venue in northern Taiwan at around 1 a.m. Tuesday after undergoing health screenings at the airport, and will be quarantined for 14 days.Military servicemen chemically disinfected the vehicles after the passengers reached the quarantine facility.All returnees will be tested for COVID-19 within 48 hours, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center.The handling of these Taiwanese who were stuck in Hubei province after it went into lockdown in late January to contain the spread of the new coronavirus has been controversial.They were all put on a list of people who required special permission to return to Taiwan, unlike other Taiwanese currently returning from areas where the virus seems much more active, such as the United States and Europe.Those on the list are being required to return on special pre-arranged flights, which the government is describing as ""charter-like flights,"" and then put in quarantine in government-run facilities after arriving home.People arriving from other parts of China or other parts of the world can take regularly scheduled commercial flights to Taiwan and self-quarantine at home for 14 days.The 214 Taiwanese had to make their way on their own from Hubei province to Shanghai's Pudong International Airport to catch the special flight operated by China Airlines, which departed at 8:02 p.m. Monday and arrived at Taoyuan International Airport at 9:38 p.m.It was the second of two special flights contracted by the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a semi-official agency that handles cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in the absence of formal bilateral ties, to bring home Taiwan citizens stuck in Hubei.The first was arranged late Sunday, when 153 Taiwanese returned home.These Taiwanese had been stranded in Hubei since late January but were able to leave the area after restrictions on the movement of people there were lifted on March 25.Many others are still stuck in Wuhan, but will be able to leave if restrictions there are lifted on April 8 as scheduled.(By Liu Chien Pang and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310002

However, it was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.It has not been a member of the United Nations or the WHO since then.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310005
3/31/2020,Hon Hai shares edge higher on 2019 results,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker that churns out many of Apple's iPhones, moved higher Tuesday morning after it reported an increase in earnings per share (EPS) for 2019, dealers said.The gains were limited, however, as investors were wary of a fall in Hon Hai's profit margins amid escalating competition in the global market and concerns over a possible delay in the launch of the next generation iPhones amid the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.As of 11:38 a.m., shares of Hon Hai had gained 0.29 percent to NT$70.20 (US$2.32), off a high of NT$70.50, on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the benchmark weighted index was up 1.13 percent at 9,738.67 following gains in the U.S. overnight.In a statement released Monday, Hon Hai said it posted net profit of NT$115.31 billion in 2019, down 10.65 percent from a year earlier, but its EPS of NT$8.32 beat its EPS of NT$8.03 in 2018.Analysts said the EPS growth largely resulted from Hon Hai's move to cut its capitalization by about 20 percent in 2018 to NT$138.63 billion to maintain its EPS above the NT$8 level.It was the first time the company had lowered its capital since it first listed publicly in June 1991.Though EPS rose in 2019, the company's lower gross margin and operating profit margin fell due to intensifying global competition, giving investors pause.The company had a gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- of 5.91 percent in 2019, down 0.36 percentage points from a year earlier, and its net margin -- the difference between its gross profit and its total expenses -- was down 0.29 percentage points to 2.15 percent in 2019.Its operating profit margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- was also down 0.42 percentage points to 2.15 percent.In addition to cutting its paid-in capital, Hon Hai was also able to maintain its EPS above NT$8 in 2019 because of efforts to automate its production, a fall in the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, and a sharp decline in the losses of subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd.The Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, in which Hon Hai holds a 62.8 percent stake, cut its net loss to US$12.29 million in 2019 from US$857.12 million a year earlier because of efforts to keep costs down.Hon Hai had consolidated sales of NT$5.34 trillion in 2019, the highest in the company's history, but they were only up 0.92 percent from a year earlier.Hon Hai said it has scheduled an annual general meeting for June 23.Analysts have estimated that Hon Hai's sales in the first quarter of 2020 will fall 40 percent from NT$1.74 trillion in the fourth quarter to below NT$1 trillion because of slow season effects and falling demand caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.(By Chung Jung-feng and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310006

""So, we are here today calling for the MOL to mandate that dormitories be located away from the workplace to save the lives of migrant workers and firefighters.""Prior to the Taoyuan fire earlier this month, six Vietnamese migrant workers in Taoyuan City died in December 2017 in a factory fire that engulfed their dormitory, which was on the upper level of a factory warehouse made of sheet iron. The structure belonged to Sican Co., which runs a factory that produces solar control window film.Four months later, a blaze at a facility operated by Chin Poon, a printed circuit board factory in Taoyuan, claimed the lives of two Thai workers who were trapped in a dormitory on the factory premises, while six firefighters died in the rescue efforts.""The firefighters rushed into the burning factory because it was their duty to save lives,"" Chu Chih-yu (朱智宇), secretary general of the National Association for Firefighters' Rights, said at Tuesday's rally. ""But if people didn't live inside the factory, then the firefighters would not have had to put their lives on the line and enter the burning building.""The migrant workers at the rally, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, along with Taiwanese supporters, shouted slogans and burned incense at a makeshift altar in memory of those who had perished in the factory fires.A Filipino, who asked to be identified only as Arturo, said when he was working at a factory in Taoyuan last year, he was housed in a dorm in the basement of the building with nine coworkers.""There was once an earthquake and we felt extremely scared because there was only one exit from the basement. Imagine a fire -- we all would have been trapped,"" said Arturo, whose right hand was severed in a factory accident last year.Another Philippine worker said, however, that work safety is not the sole responsibility of the employer, and there is no guarantee that factory employees will be safe even if their dorms are offsite.""I have seen workers cooking in their rooms when they are not supposed to, plugging as many as 10 power adaptors to one outlet in the wall, and bringing cellphones into the work area,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named.Common sense is what is most important when it comes to safety, she said, adding that she works with toxic, flammable and combustible materials on a daily basis.In response to the protesters' calls, Huang Wei-cheng (黃偉誠), a section chief at the MOL's Workforce Development Agency, said the ministry is planning to amend the law to make it mandatory for factories that have onsite dorms to file safety reports, which would include a declaration of any pyrophoric substances or flammable gases on the site.The legislation, which is expected to be completed by June, will also state how often safety checks will be carried out at factories, according to a statement issued later by the MOL.Hsu, however, expressed skepticism about such safety checks, saying that there are some 100,000 dormitories throughout Taiwan for migrant workers, while the number of inspectors responsible for checking on the welfare of the workers totals only 274.""Work safety and the general welfare checks are usually carried out once, when a migrant worker first arrives in Taiwan, due to a lack of manpower,"" Hsu said.Among the 719,847 migrant workers in Taiwan, 455,934 are employed in the industrial sector, according to MOL statistics valid as of the end of February.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310011

As a result, TSMC's market capitalization returned to the NT$7 trillion level at NT$7.1 trillion, up from Monday's NT$6.86 trillion.Led by TSMC, the bellwether electronics sector closed up 1.32 percent and the semiconductor sub-index ended up 1.72 percent.Despite the spike in the semiconductor sub-index, shares in integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. fell 2.67 percent to close at NT$327.50 amid worries over the lockdown in India, one of the Taiwanese firm's major markets, due to the virus contagion.Also in the electronics sector, PC brand Asustek Computer Inc. rose 5.96 percent to close at NT$204.50 on hopes that its notebook computer and tablet computer shipments will receive a boost with many companies worldwide asking employees to work from home.Meanwhile, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. bucked the upturn, coming off an early high to close down 0.14 percent at NT$69.60 after the company reported a day earlier a fall in its gross margins for 2019 in the wake of escalating global competition.""Despite the gains enjoyed by select large cap tech stocks, certain old economy and financial stocks came under pressure as investors remained bothered by further possible global volatility despite the Dow's latest upturn,"" Huang said.Shocked by a plunge in international crude oil prices, investors dumped petrochemical stocks with Nan Ya Plastics Corp. down 1.62 percent to close at NT$54.70, Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. down 1.03 percent to end at NT$67.00, and Formosa Plastics Corp. down 0.13 percent to close at NT$75.10.However, Wei Chuan Foods Corp. soared 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$19.95 on the back of the company's relatively high dividend yield.In the financial sector, which ended down 0.54 percent with banks' interest spreads falling, Cathay Financial Holding Co. fell 1.40 percent to close at NT$35.30, and Fubon Financial Holding Co. dropped 0.92 percent to end at NT$37.55.""There are no signs the global virus spread will ease anytime soon so many investors remained reluctant to chase prices for the moment,"" Huang said.

3/31/2020,Bank heist suspect nabbed in Taoyuan,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) A suspect who got away with NT$800,000 (US$26,429) after robbing a Bank of Panhsin branch in Taipei a day before was arrested in Taoyuan Tuesday.According to local police, the robber was caught at around 3 p.m. in front of a convenience store on Zhongxing Road in Longtang District.At the scene of the arrest, officers also found an assault rifle that he used to carry out the crime, as well as NT$600,000 in cash stashed in his car.Investigators are currently still questioning him as to his motive, including the whereabouts of the remaining missing money.The robbery took place early Monday, when he threatened two female bank clerks by firing five shots into the ceiling and ordering them to put the money into his green duffle bag.He also shot a security guard stationed at the bank in the leg.The robber then made off in a taxi that he stole outside the Zhishan MRT Station in Shilin prior to carrying out the heist.The vehicle was later found ditched on Wenhua Road in the Linkou area west of Taipei.Police immediately began looking for the suspect through surveillance cameras and finally tracked him down in Taoyuan City Tuesday.(By Huang Li-yun and Ko Lin) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310014
3/31/2020,Transgender activists release 7 policy demands,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Activists marked Tuesday's International Transgender Day of Visibility by announcing seven policy demands based on what they called the largest-ever survey of Taiwan's transgender community.At a press conference, the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) announced the results of the survey, which was open to respondents who identify as transgender under the broad definition of the term -- those whose gender identities or expressions differ from what is typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.The survey, which was conducted online March 14-25, received 518 valid responses, which served as the basis for the seven policy proposals, the TAPCPR said.The alliance's first two demands were to end the practice of requiring sex reassignment surgery for people seeking to change the gender designation on their national identification cards, as well as allowing coverage of elective sex reassignment surgeries under Taiwan's National Health Insurance program.According to a 2013 report on Taiwan's implementation of human rights by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the former requirement could constitute a form of torture, the group said.These concerns were further borne out in survey results, the TAPCPR said, in which 30.42 percent of the respondents said they were unsure about the safety of such surgeries, 29.54 percent doubted their necessity and 52.3 percent considered them prohibitively expensive.In its third and fourth demands, meanwhile, the group called for acceptance of the transgender community's collective diversity and for reforms of Taiwan's gender designation policies based on consultations with the transgender community.As an example of this diversity, the group cited survey results showing that 52 percent of the respondents identified as either male or female, while 48 percent identified themselves as nonbinary, gender-fluid or agender.Given the complexity of gender identity revealed in the survey results, the government should abandon the poorly received ""third gender policy"" it proposed in 2017, and instead should adopt new guidelines based on consultations with the transgender community, the alliance said.Fifth, the alliance called for an abolition of legal distinctions between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages.Because Taiwan's marriage equality law was passed as a special act rather than a revision of the Civil Code, which governs opposite-sex marriage, the legal rights enjoyed by the two forms of marriage vary, with a disproportionate impact on transgender individuals, the group said.For example, if a person married under the Civil Code seeks to change their gender designation and have their marriage recognized under the marriage equality act, they lose the right to adopt children as a couple and can only adopt their partner's biological children as a step-parent, the group said.On a broader social level, the alliance recommended starting gender identity education beginning in elementary school as a way of pre-empting the experience of the 47.68 percent of survey respondents who said they were bullied, discriminated against or otherwise mistreated at school.Similarly, the government should include transgender people in its monitoring of hate crimes, given that 37.3 percent of those surveyed said they had suffered workplace discrimination, the alliance said.Overall, the survey respondents reported suffering a wide range of social difficulties related to their gender identification.These included 55.41 percent who feared discrimination in public restrooms, 24.32 percent who delayed or avoided medical treatment and 22.01 percent who had been discriminated against while shopping for clothes or accessories.Another 18.53 percent said they had been sexually harassed or attacked in public, while 15.83 percent were afraid to call the police in an emergency, according to the survey results.(By Yang Su-min and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310015
3/31/2020,Constitutional Court hears debate on decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Grand justices heard arguments at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday on whether a criminal law that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after several judges asked for an interpretation of the law.Article 239 of Taiwan's Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.Eighteen judges and a male who was convicted of adultery have asked the Constitutional Court in recent years to overturn Interpretation 554, which determined that Article 239 was constitutional.The most recent one was a judge surnamed Chen (陳) from the Miaoli District Court who mainly hears cases related to ""offenses against marriage,"" who felt Article 239 may violate the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan).The court finally agreed to hear the case and heard arguments Tuesday, some of which centered around Interpretation 554.The interpretation, which was made in 2002, ruled that the freedom of sexual behavior is inseparably related to the personality of individuals, and every person is free to decide whether or not and with whom to have sexual affairs.Such freedom is, however, legally protected only if it is not detrimental to the social order or public interest as provided in Article 22 of the Constitution, and therefore the freedom of sexual behavior is subject to the restriction put on it by marriage and the family system, the ruling said.One of the judges arguing for decriminalization, Wu Chih-chiang (吳志強), said adultery is not the only factor that shakes a marriage and therefore there was no need to intervene with ""national punishment.""He argued that Article 239 could lead to unfairness and inequality in administering punishment, forcing people to maintain an unwanted marriage.Wu was referring to complaints by supporters of the decriminalization of adultery that under Article 239 the crime of adultery cannot be prosecuted without a complaint by the victim, and if one spouse withdraws charges against the other, the withdrawal does not apply to the outside party.That has led in practice to women likely to be pressured by their husbands to drop the charges against them during the proceedings, yet the cases against the mistresses go ahead.Judge Chang Yuan-sen (張淵森) argued that the purpose of criminalizing adultery was to protect the family and social morals and prevent people from suffering in a miserable marriage.Yet while the law gives people the ability to get married and divorced freely, it cannot use criminal law to ""threaten"" people into acting faithfully in a marriage, he contended.Many factors cause suffering in a marriage, including the relationship between the wife and her mother-in-law, child education problems, financial issues, and sexual relations, Chang said.""If one person suffers in a marriage, it does not mean the other party has to be punished. Suffering should not be a reason for punishment in the Criminal Code,"" he said.Chi Hui-jung (紀惠容), a former executive director of the Garden of Hope Foundation who attended the Constitutional Court as a friend of the court to present her opinions, called Article 239 a law that punishes women.Although there are more men charged for adultery than women, in the end more women, most of them the mistresses in the cases, are convicted, she said.At the same time, she argued, the crime of adultery uses the Criminal Code to deter people from having affairs, but in a society that now frowns on using corporal punishment to discipline children, it is inappropriate to use ""threats"" to keep marriages together.Deputy Minister of Justice Tsai Pi-chung (蔡碧仲) argued, however, that the criminalization of adultery is aimed at safeguarding the marriage and family system.To support her position, Tsai cited Interpretation No. 544, which says the root of the nation's marital system lies in the freedom of personality, with such social functions as the maintenance of the order of human relationships and gender equality, and the raising of children.To insure an enduring and unimpaired system of marriage, the state may of course enact relevant rules to require a husband and wife to be mutually bound to each other by the duty of faithfulness, the interpretation says.The freedoms of individuals should still be restricted by the need to maintain social order, Tsai argued, and therefore Article 239 is not unconstitutional.(By Lin Chang-shun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310016
3/31/2020,Prosecutors voice support for decriminalization of adultery,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310017
3/31/2020,Taiwan further expands screening to curb COVID-19 pandemic,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Tuesday announced that it will expand the scope of COVID-19 coronavirus screening tests to all patients with pneumonia and those who have lost their sense of smell or taste, effective immediately.Henceforth, patients with such symptoms will be required to undergo coronavirus screening tests, said CECC expert Chang Shan-chwen (張上淳) during a news briefing.Chang said the CECC decided to expand screening to patients with pneumonia in the hope that doing so will make it easier to detect those infected with COVID-19 more quickly and before they infect others.The decision came after two of the most recent cases were individuals with no recent overseas travel history, who tested positive for coronavirus only after doctors sent their samples for screening following a pneumonia diagnosis, according to the CECC.As of Monday, 24 of the more than 300 confirmed cases in Taiwan were found to have lost their sense of smell or taste, prompting the CECC to subject those with such symptoms to screening, he added.Previously, Taiwan only conducted COVID-19 tests on those with respiratory symptoms and fever who had recently traveled to countries with coronavirus outbreaks, or who had contact with coronavirus patients.The CECC last week further expanded the scope of screening to medical and healthcare workers with suspected infection symptoms in order to prevent possible cluster infections in the nation's healthcare system.Taiwan recorded 16 new infections on Tuesday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 322 with five deaths since the coronavirus emerged in China at the end of last year, according to CECC statistics.As of Tuesday, the CEEC had conducted 31,800 tests since the epidemic started in late December.(By Chen Wei-ting, Yu Hsiao-han and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310018

3/31/2020,Taiwan's surgical mask output hits 13 million per day,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Taiwan's daily surgical mask output has hit 13 million, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Tuesday.The current daily output is more than four times the amount that Taiwan was capable of producing in early February, when Taiwan produced an average of 3.2 million surgical masks per day.That amount, however, is far from enough to meet the demand for surgical masks, which are widely used in Taiwan to prevent against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.In response to the high demand, the government banned the export of all surgical masks in late January, requisitioned all domestically produced masks, and instituted a rationing system to limit the number of masks people could buy per week.It also purchased 92 mask production lines, which have been set up in 40 days and have largely contributed to the significant surge in output.With the increase in output, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced Monday that people would be able to buy more masks under the rationing system in April.From April 9, residents will have access to nine masks for adults every 14 days, up from three per week at present, while the quota for children's masks will remain at 10 every two weeks, the CECC said.The MOEA is also discussing whether to purchase production lines that can produce N95 masks, which are able to filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles and are mainly used by medical workers on the frontlines.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310020

""MOFA will continue to work with the U.S. and other like-minded countries to advance our shared values and common goals and deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership on the global stage.""The TAIPEI Act was first introduced in the U.S. Senate by Cory Gardner last May, with Republican Congressman John Curtis unveiling a similar version in the House of Representatives in October, amid Beijing's continued efforts to squeeze Taiwan's international space.The legislation was passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier this month and later signed into law by Trump.The Act calls on the U.S. government to further Taiwan-U.S. bilateral trade and economic relations, help Taiwan participate in international organizations, and strengthen Taiwan's partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific region and in the world, according to Ou.It also authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider altering its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious actions to undermine Taiwan's security and prosperity, she said.The Republic of China (Taiwan), a founding member of the WHO, was kicked out of the United Nations-affiliated organization in May 1972 after the U.N. formally recognized the Beijing government as the only legitimate representative of China seven months earlier.International support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.Taiwan has been trying to rejoin the WHO since 1997. From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan was able to participate in the WHA as an observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" with Beijing's approval, as cross-Taiwan Strait relations were warmer at the time.Since 2017, however, the year after President Tai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) took office, the Chinese government has been blocking Taiwan's efforts to participate in the WHA, due to differences between Taipei and Beijing over the so called ""1992 Consensus.""The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China,"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310022

3/31/2020,Taiwan's COVID-19 response could reach NT$1 trillion: premier,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) The Taiwan government's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could reach as much as NT$1 trillion (US$33 billion), Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) told a legislative hearing on Tuesday.Such a figure would more adequately reflect the global nature of the crisis than the NT$60 billion special budget the Executive Yuan proposed in February, when the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was mainly limited to China, Su said.In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee De-wei (李德維) asked Su to detail the timing and scale of response measures being planned by the government, inquiring whether it would seek anything on the scale of Singapore's recently announced S$48 billion (US$33.65 billion) stimulus plan.""The overall scale will likely be around NT$1 trillion,"" Su said, arguing that the size of various countries' response measures will vary based on a variety of factors.In the United States, for example, people use private, rather than public insurance, while Taiwan uses the National Health Insurance program. Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202003310025

4/12/2020,127 European parliamentarians support Taiwan's WHA bid,"Taipei, April 12 (CNA) In a series of letters, 127 European parliamentarians have expressed support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwan's foreign ministry said Saturday.One of the letters, dated April 8 and addressed to European Union High Representative Josep Borrell, was signed by 67 EU parliamentarians from six party caucuses, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said.""The WHO treatment of Taiwan as part of China has caused problems for Taiwan,"" according to a copy of the letter that was posted on Twitter by one of the signatories, former Poland Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga.Not only is Taiwan's democratically elected government barred from participation in the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), but Taiwanese experts are also arbitrarily prevented from attending the WHO's technical meetings, the letter stated.""In these difficult times, the substantial cooperation in areas such as medical supplies, research and development of vaccines between Taiwan, the EU and its Member States would be beneficial in order to curb the further spread of the pandemic and better prepare for any future outbreak,"" the letter reads.One of the other letters was signed by 60 legislators of the German Parliament on April 2 and addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been heavily criticized by the U.S. and several other countries for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to MOFA.Anita Schäfer, chairperson of the German-Chinese Association-Friends of Taiwan, wrote in that letter that the WHO's treatment of Taiwan was inconsistent with its organizational values, MOFA said.The foreign ministry expressed appreciation for the support of the 127 European parliamentarians, saying they were the ""voice of justice.""The empathy of those parliamentarians for Taiwan is in sharp contrast to Tedros' biased statements about Taiwan, MOFA said.Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist, should be impartial and professional on the matter of the Taiwanese people's health and welfare, MOFA said.Since Taiwan was expelled from the WHO in 1972, its participation in the WHA as an observer has been limited to an eight-year period, from 2009 to 2016, amid relatively warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations during that time.International support for Taiwan's bid to rejoin in the WHO and WHA have been growing recently, amid concern over the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic and in recognition of Taiwan's efforts to contain the virus.(By Chen Yun-yu and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202004120001

5/7/2020,U.S. secretary of state urges WHO chief to invite Taiwan to WHA,"Washington, May 6 (CNA) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday called on the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA), saying it is within a WHO director-general's power to do so.In a press briefing, Pompeo reiterated Washington's support for Taipei's participation as an observer in this year's WHA, the decision-making body of the WHO, which will be held online from May 18-19 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.""Today I want to call upon all nations, including those in Europe, to support Taiwan's participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly and in other relevant United Nations venues,"" he said.He also urged WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to invite Taiwan to the WHA, ""as he has the power to do, and as his predecessors have done on multiple occasions.""Pompeo was referring to the fact that Tedros' predecessor, Margaret Chan (陳馮富珍), had sent invitations to Taiwan to observe the WHA from 2009 to 2016.Asked to comment if he will consider sending an invitation to Taiwan during a WHO press event held in Geneva that day, Tedros did not answer the question, referring it instead to WHO Legal Counsel Derek Walton.Walton reiterated the WHO's stance that the WHO secretariat has no authority to make such a decision unilaterally as it is to be made by all 194 member states.""The involvement, if any, of observers from 'Taiwan, China' in that assembly is a question for the 194 member governments, it's their decision,"" he noted.He also said that a number of member states have already raised proposals to discuss the matter at this year's WHA.He continued that whether or not Taiwan is invited to the assembly this year, there are ""well-established arrangements"" for health experts from ""Taiwan, China"" to work with the WHO on technical health matters.Taiwan participated in the WHA meetings from 2009 to 2016 as on observer under the name ""Chinese Taipei"" amid warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations under the then-Kuomintang (KMT) administration, which prioritized reducing cross-strait tension and building friendly ties with Beijing.Since 2017, however, China has persuaded the WHO not to invite Taiwan, in line with its hardline stance on cross-strait ties after President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office in May 2016.Explaining its decision for not sending invitations to Taiwan since 2017, the WHO said in 2019 that ""previous invitations to the WHA have been issued on the basis of a 'cross-strait understanding,'"" and that the ""absence of such an understanding"" in recent years has resulted in the fact that no more such invitations have been issued.According to the WHO Constitution, although the specialized agency under the U.N. does not recognize observer status, the rules of WHA procedure give the WHO director-general the right to invite observers to the annual WHA meeting, provided that they are ""States that have made application for membership, territories on whose behalf application for associate membership has been made, and States which have signed but not accepted the Constitution.""In response to Pompeo's remarks, Taiwan's foreign ministry on Thursday expressed gratitude, saying that it will continue to work closely with the U.S. and other like-minded countries in sharing Taiwan's success in containing the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The ministry also issued a protest over Walton's remarks that called the nation ""Taiwan, China,"" saying the designation belittled the nation's sovereignty.  (By Stacy Hsu, Tang Pei-chun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005070004

He was 96.Chung's son Chung Yen-wei (鍾延威) told reporters that the family found Chung not breathing around 7 p.m. Saturday.Chung Yen-wei said despite his father's old age, he was in relative stable health over the years. The family is deeply saddened and shocked by Chung's sudden passing and is now preparing his funeral.Born in Taoyuan's Longtan district in 1925 during Japanese rule, Chung was widely considered the doyen of Taiwan's ""nativist literature movement,"" who was most famous for his works, ""The Dull Ice Flower (魯冰花),"" ""the Turbid Waters Trilogy"" (濁流三部曲) and ""the Taiwanese Trilogy"" (台灣人三部曲).His classics of Taiwanese literature depicts the lives and fates of Taiwanese against the background of post-World War II Taiwan, following the end of the Japanese colonial period.In mourning the passing of Chung, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) expressed condolence to his family and said the passing of the nonagenarian literati is a great loss to the nation's literary circle.In a Facebook post, Tsai also praised Chung, an ethnic Hakka, for playing an import role in promoting Hakka culture and Taiwanese literature.Chung and other writers of his time had jointly published a regular newsletter in the post WWII era, the Literary Bulletin -- a periodical that proved essential to young and aspiring writers of that time, according to Tsai.Tsai said she will always remember Chung as an elder who saw her as his own child. She pledged to bear Chung's teaching in mind to continue the promotion of Hakka and Taiwanese culture so that Chung's legacy will last for generations to come.Asked to comment on Chung's legacy, writer Chen Fang-ming (陳芳明) told CNA that Chung had a tremendous impact toward the development of Taiwanese literature.Chung had played an crucial rule during the transitional period in the 1950s after the Kuomintang (KMT) had just taken over the governing of Taiwan from Japan at the end of Japanese colonial rule, according to Chen.Sincere condolences on the passing of #Hakka literary master Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政). The esteemed writer passed away on May 16 at the age of 96. https://t.co/zUbiiwwuCE pic.twitter.com/PH02BDFO0WAt that time, most Taiwanese could only speak Japanese and very few people could speak Mandarin, let alone write in the Chinese language. Chung was one of a handful of native Taiwanese writers of that time that can.Aside from focusing on his own works, Chung also published the Literary Bulletin that offered a platform for Taiwanese writers to publish their works.Chung's works had faithfully recorded the everyday lives of Taiwanese people of his time which showed his deep connection and affection toward his homeland, Chen noted.The Hakka Affairs Council, meanwhile, remembered Chung as not only a prolific writer but a devoted promoter of Hakka affairs who helped promote the awareness of Hakka culture to a national level, which successfully led to the creation in the 1990s of a dedicated Hakka language radio station.(By Chiu Chun-chin, Su Lung-chi Chen Ping-hung, Wu Hsin-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005170003

Those cases have not yet been classified as either local or imported, CECC data showed.To date, 395 COVID-19 patients in Taiwan have recovered, seven have died, with the remainder are still hospitalized, the CECC said in a statement.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 4,660,752 people in 187 countries and regions, including 1,489,642 in the United States, 272,043 in Russia, 240,161 in the United Kingdom, 230,698 in Spain and 224,760 in Italy, with a total of 311,064 fatalities, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.(By William Yen) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005170005
5/17/2020,Hostess club in Tainan reopens to customers amid COVID-19,"Tainan, May 17 (CNA) A hostess dance club in Tainan reopened Saturday, becoming the first such club in Taiwan's six major metropolitan areas to restart business after being shut down last month because of fears it could easily spread COVID-19.Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) said the city government issued a business resumption permit to the Wan Hsiang Dance Club (萬象舞廳) Friday after the club passed a government inspection.The 35-year-old Wan Hsiang Dance Club is so far the only legitimate hostess club among the five in the southern Taiwan city that has applied to reopen, according to Huang.City government officials said owners of the club pledged to implement the Central Epidemic Command Center's (CECC's) epidemic prevention guidelines against COVID-19 as it reopens its doors to customers.These guidelines include asking customers to follow social distancing measures, having them wear a face mask, taking their temperatures, and getting them to use hand sanitizer before entering the clubs.The club will also be required to control the flow of people by keeping a register of those entering, the city government said.The club's owners pledged to register the name and ID card numbers of each customer, and transparent plastic partitions have also been installed in each private booth to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Customers will also be forbidden to dance with a partner despite the resumption of operations, but will be allowed to dance alone, the club said, without elaborating.Huang said city officials will conduct inspections of the club to make sure it is following related guidelines, and the club will be closed for a week should violations be reported.Local media quoted the 75-year-old owner of the club surnamed Tseng (曾) as saying that the month-long suspension is the longest period of time the establishment has been closed during its 35-year history.The shutdown has seriously affected the livelihoods of the club's 100 employees and 200 hostesses, and they are all eager to see business resume, Tseng was cited as saying.The CECC on April 9 ordered hostess clubs across the country shut down, saying they posed a high risk of spreading COVID-19 after a hostess at a club in Taipei was confirmed to have the disease.As the number of cases dwindled to practically zero in the first week of May, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, announced on May 8 that local governments could decide whether to reopen their cities' hostess clubs under certain conditions.Tainan is the only one of Taiwan's six special municipalities -- which also include Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung -- to allow hostess bars to reopen so far.(By Chang Rong-hsiang and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005170006

5/17/2020,Taiwan advised to work with major economies after COVID-19,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Taiwan must seize the opportunity to work with major economies seeking to relocate global supply chains outside of China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic scholars suggested as President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) begins her second term on May 20.The pandemic, which has made many countries aware of their growing economic dependence on China for goods in several critical sectors, has led to calls to delink global supply chains of major industries from China.That trend offers an extremely good opportunity to Taiwan, said Ray Yang (楊瑞臨), consulting director of the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center (ISTI) under the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).He said the United States, China and Europe may all look to develop independent production capabilities in the post-COVID-19 world, and Taiwan has an opportunity to become an important partner for all of them.Yang said the U.S. will still be the world leader but cannot go it alone and will itself have to form partnerships with economies such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Taiwan is well positioned, Yang said, because the COVID-19 crisis has opened the world's eyes to the strengths of Taiwanese businesses, including their ability to respond quickly to different situations, high degree of flexibility and quality of manufactured goods.That was seen most clearly in Taiwan's ramping up of production of face masks and protective gear for medical workers to meet high demand during the coronavirus epidemic, he said.Meanwhile, Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, predicted that the U.S. economy would recover faster from the coronavirus pandemic than China.That trend has already prompted more Taiwanese businesses operating overseas to increase investment in Taiwan and reduce investment in China and other countries, Chiu said.Chiu also contended it will be in Taiwan's interests if the United States create an alliance of ""trusted partners"" to restructure supply chains away from China, as has been reported.According to a Reuters report in early May, the alliance would apply common standards for everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to trade, education and commerce, with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, India and Vietnam among potential partners.Though Taiwan is not on the list of ""trusted partners,"" it is a reasonable assumption that Taiwan has an opportunity to be included in the next phase given that Taiwan is considered a partner in the U.S.'s ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,"" Chiu said.""We must let the United States know that Taiwan can make its planned supply chains more complete,"" Chiu said, pointing to Taiwan's semiconductor industry's advantage in wafer fabrication and packaging and testing technology, which would help build the U.S.'s IC design capabilities.Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises' strength in producing spare parts and component production could also strengthen those new supply chains, Chiu said.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wu Po-wei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005170008
5/17/2020,Norwegian expats celebrate National Day with parade in Taiwan,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) Norwegian expatriates in Taiwan held a parade and a flag-raising ceremony Sunday to celebrate Norway's National Day in what may have been the only parade around the world marking the occasion this year.More than a dozen Norwegians, some with their families, and about 60 members of the Taiwan Digital Diplomacy Association (TDDA), participated in the 40-minute parade that started in Daan District in Taipei and ended at the Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab, where the flag-raising ceremony was held.The activities were jointly organized by Norwegian nationals in Taiwan and the TDDA, a Taiwanese NGO dedicated to public diplomacy.""Interactions between Norway and Taiwan usually involve business or government issues. We hope today's event will bring the civil societies of the two countries closer,"" said TDDA Chairwoman Kuo Chia-yo (郭家佑), who began connecting with Norwegians in Taiwan three months ago.Other activities had been held in recent weeks to mark Norwegian National Day, including Norwegian cooking classes, a workshop on drawing a map of Norway, and a language-learning class, she said.Geir Yeh Fotland, a Norwegian born in Taiwan, told CNA that Norway's government has suspended all gatherings, including its National Day parade, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, making the Taipei event special.""I think this might be the only Norwegian National Day parade in the world, at least the longest with more than 60 people. So that's a great event,"" said Fotland, fondly called ""Norwegian grandpa"" by many Taiwanese who know him.Oslo is usually not keen on promoting Taiwan due to Beijing's influence in recent years, but major newspapers in Norway started to mention Taiwan in May because of its good performance in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, he said.""Taiwan has shown the world that we are independent from COVID-19 while the rest of the world is occupied by COVID-19, as Norway.""Oslo cut its official ties with Taipei in January 1950. Neither government has a liaison office on the other's soil after Oslo closed its trade office in Taipei in 2004 and Taipei closed its representative office in Norway in 2017.According to Fotland, there are about 10 Norwegian students and six to eight Norwegian nationals living in Taiwan, some of them retired and others here doing business.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005170009

5/17/2020,Rights group urges Taiwan to allow cross-national same-sex marriage,"Taipei, May 17 (CNA) The Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) and several same-sex couples on Sunday urged Taiwan's government to allow same-sex marriages between couples from different countries.Taiwan's government legalized same-sex marriage in May 2019, becoming the first Asian country to do so.According to the Act Governing the Choice of Law in Civil Matters Involving Foreign Elements, however, a cross-national same-sex marriage can only be recognized in Taiwan if the countries of which the two partners are citizens both recognize same-sex marriage.The restriction discriminates against the LGBT community in Taiwan as marriage is a constitutional right, Pan Tien-ching (潘天慶), a lawyer from the TAPCPR, said at a press conference held near Taiwan's Presidential Office Building.Several cross-national same-sex couples lamented their difficult situations at the press conference.""For many cross-national same-sex couples, including me and my wife, our efforts to be with our loved ones are symbolized by our old plane ticket stubs,"" said Kaili Lai, a Taiwanese LGBT married to a Malaysian Tan Bee Guat.According to Lai, she and Tan held a simple wedding in Malaysia in 2016 with the blessings of their parents.Tan was not allowed to live in Taiwan, however because she was not a Taiwanese citizen and could not get a residence certificate because her marriage to Lai was not recognized.They had to fly frequently between Taiwan and Malaysia to see each other, leaving Tan little choice but to enroll in a university in Taiwan as a freshmen at the age of 35 to be able to stay in Taiwan on a student visa.But Tan is graduating next month and will have to enroll in a graduate school program to continue staying in Taiwan.Another cross-national same-sex couple, Joyce from Taiwan and Queenie from the Philippines, are facing the same predicament -- Queenie has to enroll in National Taiwan Normal University for the same purpose.According to the TAPCPR, the signature campaign it launched on May 9 to petition the government to amend laws that restrict same-sex marriage between such couples received 13,500 signatures and support from 20 human rights watchdogs in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Indonesia and the United States.The TAPCPR said it had written to relevant government units such as the Ministry of Justice, Mainland Affairs Council, National Immigration Agencies and the Ministry of Interiors on the issue.""Most government agencies have agreed that the issues need to be addressed but admitted that more coordination between relevant agencies is needed,"" the TAPCPR said as it urged President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to resolve the issue.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005170011

5/20/2020,Full text of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's second-term inaugural address,"Taipei, May 20 (CNA) The following is the full text of President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) inaugural address to start her second term, as released by the Presidential Office Wednesday:Vice President Lai, esteemed guests, friends watching on TV and online, my fellow citizens across the country, good morning.I feel immensely grateful to stand here once again today and take on the responsibility entrusted to me by the Taiwanese people.This inauguration ceremony is unique in the history of the Republic of China. What makes it special is not its size or the number of people in attendance. It is special because we know how difficult it has been for us to get to this point.I want to thank the people of Taiwan for making such a difficult feat possible.I particularly want to thank a group of people who have not received a lot of attention over the past four months in our fight against COVID-19. I want to thank every single person who waited in line outside of the pharmacy in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for trusting the government. You have shown the world Taiwan's commitment to civic virtues, even in times of greatest distress.I also want to thank everyone who was quarantined or isolated at home, putting up with inconvenience in your daily life to keep others safe and healthy. Thank you for exemplifying humanity's best qualities and helping us successfully bring the coronavirus outbreak under control.This sense of pride in our country, this community's shared destiny, and the memories of these past months will live on in all of our hearts. This is what solidarity feels like.Many ambassadors and representatives from other countries are here today, and I trust that many countries around the world are watching Taiwan as well.I want to take this opportunity to tell you that the country you see is populated by kind and resilient people. No matter the difficulties we face, we can always count on our democracy, our solidarity, and our sense of responsibility towards each other to help us overcome challenges, weather difficult times, and stand steadfast in the world.From January to now, Taiwan has amazed the international community twice. The first was our democratic elections, and the second was our success in the fight against COVID-19.In recent months, Taiwan's name has appeared in headlines around the world, thanks to our successful containment of the coronavirus outbreak.""Taiwan"" is also emblazoned on the boxes of supplies we are sending abroad. The Taiwanese people have the kindest hearts in the entire world, and we will always offer help to the international community whenever we are able.I hope that in addition to sharing in a sense of pride and joy, my fellow citizens can take to heart the spirit of ""helping ourselves to help others;"" ""when we help ourselves, others will help us.""This pandemic has not yet ended, and we must remain vigilant. Even when it ends, its impacts will linger on.The coronavirus has profoundly affected our world. It has changed the global political and economic order, accelerated and expanded the reorganization of global supply chains, restructured the global economy, and changed the way we live and shop. It has even changed the way the international community views Taiwan and developments in the surrounding region.These changes present us with both challenges and opportunities. I want to ask that my fellow citizens be prepared, because countless challenges and difficulties remain ahead of us.Over the next four years, only those who can end the pandemic within their borders, lay out a strategy for their country's survival and development, and take advantage of opportunities in the complex world of tomorrow, will be able to set themselves apart on the international stage.It takes more than fervor to govern a country. Leadership means calmly taking the right direction in a changing world. That is precisely what I have done over the past four years.I said before that I will leave you with a better country. So over the next four years, I will proactively develop our industries, foster a safe society, ensure national security, and deepen our democracy. I am going to reinvent Taiwan and lead our country into the future.1. Industrial and Economic DevelopmentI know that the Taiwanese people are most concerned about our industrial and economic development. In 2016, we initiated a new economic development model to help connect Taiwan's economy to the world. Over the past four years, despite massive changes in the international economy, Taiwan has done more than just weather the storm. Our economic growth has once again topped the Four Asian Tigers, and the stock market index now regularly breaks 10,000 points.Thanks to our successful control of the pandemic, so far, Taiwan is able to maintain positive economic growth. This is rare in the world. However, we need to continue to take early action on economic relief and revitalization, and do whatever it takes to maintain stable economic growth.Over the next four years, we will face more intense changes in the global economy and the accelerated reorganization of supply chains. We will continue to implement our Forward-looking Infrastructure Development and trillion NT-dollar investment programs. We will do so in the spirit of ""achieving growth through stability, and seizing opportunity amid changes,"" in order to secure Taiwan's economic development over the coming decades.In terms of industrial development, we are going to take advantage of the opportunities before us in six core strategic industries founded on our 5+2 Innovative Industries Program, to transform Taiwan into a critical force in the global economy.First, we will continue to develop our information and digital industries. We will take advantage of Taiwan's strengths in the semiconductor and ICT industries to secure a central role in global supply chains, and make Taiwan a major base for the development of next generation technologies, including IoT and AI.Second, we are going to develop a cybersecurity industry that can integrate with 5G, digital transformation, and our national security. We will strive to create cybersecurity systems and an industrial chain that can protect our country and earn the world's trust.Third, we are going to create biotech and medical technology industries integrated with the rest of the world. Throughout this pandemic, Taiwanese teams have proven that they are capable of working with world-class technologies to produce reagents and develop new drugs and vaccines. We are going to give these industries our utmost support, and transform Taiwan into a key force in the global battle against infectious diseases.Fourth, we are going to develop national defense and strategic industries by integrating military and civilian capabilities. In addition to domestically-produced naval vessel and aircraft programs that are currently underway, we will push harder to promote technological integration between the military and the private sector, to stimulate private sector production capabilities, and advance into the aviation and space industries.Fifth, we are going to accelerate the development of green energy and renewable energy industries. Over the past four years, renewable energy has experienced explosive growth, and Taiwan has become a hotspot for international investment. Building on this foundation, I am confident that we will achieve our goal of deriving 20% of our overall energy from green sources by 2025. We are going to make Taiwan a center for green energy in Asia.Sixth, we are going to establish strategic stockpile industries that can ensure the steady provision of critical supplies. Facing changes to the global order, we need to keep key industrial chains in Taiwan and maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency in the production of face masks, medical and daily supplies, energy, and food.In the current international climate, countries that end their dependence on others will have a head start on national development. I would like our friends across all industries to rest assured that our government stands with you. Over the next few years, we have several strategies to drive the growth of our industries.First, we will use domestic demand, particularly demand from the public sector and national security needs, as the basic engine for our industrial development.A prime example of this is the way strategic demand for face masks and other medical supplies throughout this pandemic has spurred the development of related industries. We can adopt a similar model for our national defense and renewable energy industries to help accelerate their development.We will continue to organize ""national teams,"" like our face mask team, according to the size and conditions of different industries. We will utilize our government's guarantee of domestic demand to establish a global strategic materials manufacturing industry under the ""Taiwanese brand"" and help it expand into other markets.We know that financial support is crucial to industrial development. Looking to the future, we will adopt more flexible financial policies, continue to reform financial systems, and use more diverse means to help industries obtain the financing they need.We will also work to create a safe environment for our industries. Our government is committed to maintaining sound public health and national security systems, a stable society, strong rule of law, and a healthy market. We need to offer these guarantees so that high-tech and strategic industries will be willing to choose Taiwan as their production and R&D base.We will also continue to guide the global expansion of our industries. We will keep working to sign trade or investment protection agreements with the United States, Japan, and European countries.As we continue to promote our New Southbound Policy, we will also develop other potential markets and encourage firms to establish operations there, giving our industries an edge when they engage in international cooperation. Overseas Taiwanese business communities around the world will be our best partners as we seek new international opportunities.Finally, we have the issue of talent. In order for Taiwan to become a key global economic force, we need a diverse talent pool. My government will bring in the world's top technical, R&D, and management talents to help globalize Taiwan's workforce, widen our industries' horizons, and give them the ability to compete in the international arena.Looking to the future, Taiwan must further connect with the international community. We will work to cultivate more outstanding bilingual and digital talents, giving our industries a global competitive edge.Over the next four years, Taiwan's economy will enter a new stage, complete with more flexible capital and talent flows, more robust industrial capabilities, and closer ties with the world. Together, we are going to enter a new era of shared prosperity.2. Safe Society: Health and Social Safety Nets to Catch Those Who Need HelpAs we develop our industries, we will also keep in mind that the people expect the government to foster a safe society. To be a better country, the government must take on more responsibilities to reduce the burden on the people and mitigate issues in society.Over the past few years, we have addressed Long-term Care 2.0, childcare, and residential justice issues. Over the next four years, my goal is to weave an even tighter net that can catch every single person who needs help and prevent future tragedies.●Health and Disease Prevention Safety NetFirst, we will strengthen our health and disease prevention safety net. Taiwan is an ageing society, and infectious diseases pose a serious challenge to the health of our people. That is why we need to bolster our disease prevention and treatment capabilities and link industries to make more breakthroughs in vaccine and new drug development, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, so that people can enjoy healthy lives and receive better care.●Mending Gaps in the Social Safety NetOur second step will be to mend the gaps in our social safety net. Over the past few years, a great deal of discussion has arisen around public safety incidents involving schizophrenia patients. The same goes for other mental illnesses, drug addiction, and domestic violence.I understand your concerns. These issues are not just the responsibility of individuals or families, they are the responsibility of the government. When families are unable to provide proper care, the government has a duty to step in and help.I am going to upgrade our social care system, enhance the capabilities of frontline social workers, and improve their work environments, so that they can work at the grassroots and identify people who have fallen through the gaps in our safety net.We cannot hold medical agencies or individual judges solely responsible for controversies surrounding specific cases. Our judicial and executive branches should reevaluate and optimize these systems and take initiatives to make any necessary legal amendments.3. National Security: National Defense Reforms, Active International Participation, Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsA better country requires a greater emphasis on national security. Over the past four years, we have pushed for national defense reforms, active international participation, and peaceful, stable cross-strait relations. We hope that Taiwan can play a more active role in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Over the next four years, the direction of our policies will remain the same, and we will do even more.●National Defense ReformsWe have three important directions for our national defense reforms. First is accelerating the development of our asymmetrical capabilities. While we work to bolster our defense capabilities, future combat capacity development will also emphasize mobility, countermeasures, and non-traditional asymmetrical capabilities. We will also work to strengthen our defenses against the threats of cyber warfare, cognitive warfare, and ""unrestricted"" warfare to achieve our strategic goal of multidomain deterrence.The second is substantive reforms to our military reserve and mobilization systems. We need to enhance the quality of our reserve forces, as well as their weapons, equipment, and training, in order to achieve effective jointness with our regular forces. We also need to establish a standing, interdepartmental system connecting our reserve and mobilization systems. This system will help coordinate personnel and supplies, so that we can successfully mobilize during a transition from peacetime to war.Third is improvements to our military's management institutions. Today's young servicemembers have all grown up in a democratic society, and one of our most important missions will be to find ways for them to better utilize their professional skills in line with military needs.Some young servicemembers have difficulties adjusting to military needs, reflecting the gap between today's society and our military management institutions. We need to work to close that gap. We need to reduce negative societal views of the military and end the gradual erosion of our military's prestige and morale due to individual incidents caused by imperfect institutions.Thus, we will improve appeal and counseling mechanisms within the military, establish a fair and equitable incident investigation mechanism, and regularly evaluate personnel placements. In terms of education and training, we will strengthen leadership capacities across all levels of leadership and foster a modern management system that emphasizes professionalism.We need to strike a balance between the team-oriented military discipline needed for actual combat and society's respect for the individual.●Active International ParticipationOver the past four years, we have actively taken part in addressing major global issues, including counter-terrorism cooperation, humanitarian assistance, religious freedom, and nontraditional security.Throughout this global pandemic, we have been praised for providing selfless assistance to the international community wherever we are able.Taiwan has been deemed a democratic success story, a reliable partner, and a force for good in the world by the international community. All Taiwanese people should take pride in this.Over the next four years, we will continue to fight for our participation in international organizations, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with our allies, and bolster ties with the United States, Japan, Europe, and other like-minded countries.We will also participate more actively in regional cooperation mechanisms and work hand-in-hand with countries in the region to make concrete contributions to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.●Peaceful and Stable Cross-strait RelationsIn the face of complex and changing cross-strait circumstances, we have made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait over the past four years, gaining approval from the international community. We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security.Here, I want to reiterate the words ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue."" We will not accept the Beijing authorities' use of ""one country, two systems"" to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle.We will continue to handle cross-strait affairs according to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. This has been our consistent position for maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Cross-strait relations have reached a historical turning point. Both sides have a duty to find a way to coexist over the long term and prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences. Faced with changing circumstances, I will hold firm to my principles, adopt an open attitude to resolve issues, and shoulder my responsibilities as President. I also hope that the leader on the other side of the Strait will take on the same responsibility, and work with us to jointly stabilize the long-term development of cross-strait relations.While we work to achieve national development, it is crucial that we optimize our government institutions over the next four years. Our Legislative Yuan will establish a constitutional amendment committee, giving us a platform to engage in dialogue and reach a consensus on constitutional reforms pertaining to government systems and people's rights.This democratic process will enable the constitutional system to progress with the times and align with the values of Taiwanese society. Our first priority should be to lower the voting age from 20 to 18, an issue on which both the majority and opposition parties are in agreement.In terms of judicial reform, I delivered on my promise to convene a National Congress on Judicial Reform, and we completed amendments to the Judges Act, the Attorney Regulation Act, the Constitutional Court Procedure Act, and the Labor Incident Act. This is all base work for the further improvement of our judicial system.However, our judicial reforms are still in transition, and our current progress has not yet met the public's expectations. I will continue to solicit opinions from across society and keep pressing forward. The people's dissatisfaction drives us to continue on the path of reform.Within the next four years, we need to implement a lay judge system, so that citizens can act as lay judges in court and become catalysts for judicial reform. This will help bridge the distance between the people and our judicial system, so that it aligns better with their expectations and earns their trust.All constitutional institutions must also continue on the path of reform. The Executive Yuan will reevaluate and reinitiate its organizational reform process, including the establishment of a specialized digital development agency and adjustments to all ministries in line with current needs. This will enable governance capabilities to be more responsive to the needs of national development.The National Human Rights Commission under the Control Yuan will officially be established in August of this year. This will be a milestone in our journey to place human rights at the center of Taiwan's national ethos, and marks the start of a new chapter for the Control Yuan.Our new Examination Yuan team will be instated in September, and I will ask them to propose a comprehensive reform plan and evaluate past policies, so that they can become an effective human resource department that can cultivate the talent a modern government needs.My fellow citizens, over the past 70 years, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has grown more resilient and unified through countless challenges. We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation. We have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Although we were once isolated in the world, we have always persisted in the values of democracy and freedom, no matter the challenges ahead of us. We will always remain committed to our common belief: Taiwan must help ourselves to help others, and when we help ourselves, others will help us.Many of the heroes in our fight against COVID-19 are here with us today, including members of our national face mask team, our Central Epidemic Command Center's public health team, and Premier Su Tseng-chang's team.There are many more heroes from all walks of life not in attendance today: medical workers, postal workers, pharmacists, convenience store clerks, taxi drivers, and many more.I may not be able to call out all of your names, but I want everyone to know that Taiwan has overcome countless challenges over the past 70 years, relying on not just one or two heroes, but thanks to countless heroes such as yourselves, working together to turn the wheels of history. You have helped make Taiwan a happy, safe, and prosperous place for generations to come.I want to express my respect to all of you. Every single person in Taiwan is a hero. Vice President Lai and I are honored to take on the responsibility you have entrusted to us.Taking on the responsibility of the President of the Republic of China in such difficult times brings me more pressure than joy. But I will not back down, because all of you are with me.The path forward will not be easy, and greater challenges await us. But we are a country that has persevered through even the greatest hardships. We, the 23 million people, have always been and will always be a community with a shared destiny.I truly hope that all of my fellow citizens will remember how it felt to come together to overcome the challenges of the past few months. The Republic of China can be united. Taiwan can be safe. Being Taiwanese can be an honor that makes you hold your head high.My dear citizens, the path ahead of us is long, and we are about to begin a new chapter in Taiwan's story. Taiwan's story belongs to each and every one of us, and it needs each and every one of us.I ask that the 23 million people of Taiwan act as our guides and partners. Let us pool our wisdom and courage and make this country a better place together. Thank you.（For the full text in Mandarin: 最特別的就職典禮 蔡總統：感謝台灣人民【演說全文】）",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005200003

5/22/2020,A new 'internet for everything' era on the way: expert,"By Kay Liu, CNA staff writerThe global COVID-19 pandemic has upended people's lives, giving terms such as stay at home, work from home, and social distancing added resonance and accentuating the importance of the internet in connecting with others and doing one's job.What many are wondering is if these lifestyle changes will become entrenched and workplaces permanently altered even as the pandemic eases and people can move freely again.Kenny Huang, the chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), says the trends are here to stay, and he foresees a world of ""internet for everything,"" in which even more tasks will be done online.""Before the pandemic, the internet was an information technology tool. For businesses, it was used to help with operations, marketing or other areas. But in the post-COVID-19 era, all business activities will likely be connected to the internet,"" Huang said in a recent interview with CNA.Huang is in as good a position as anybody to look into the future of cyberspace.His TWNIC, which manages domain names ending with .tw and internet protocol (IP) addresses in Taiwan, routinely conducts surveys and issues reports on internet use that offer insights into trends and developments in the online world and help businesses make decisions.He believes COVID-19 has already made the internet part of a new reality because people no longer feel that things have to be done face-to-face, at least judging by the surge in online traffic and bandwidth he has observed from Dec. 30, 2019 to March 23.Huang estimates that the internet is used in about 10 percent of everyday work at present, but he expects that to go much higher in the future as habits change.Possible risksThe increasingly internet-dependent world that Huang envisions could have a downside, however, with risks that already exist such as threats to cybersecurity or the monopolization of information potentially magnified, he said.He pointed to the possibility of a wider spread of disinformation if people become more reliant on digital media as a news source.""There are always new solutions, but there will always be new types of disruptions,"" said Huang, who used the example of fake news evolving from pure fiction to mixing in some facts to create misinformation.The new solutions, he said, are the likes of the review mechanism introduced by Facebook and Twitter and the work of organizations such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center.Social mediaSocial media could also fall prey to the growing importance of the internet, Huang suggested.At its core, the internet is about transmitting data and connecting devices, while social media plays the role of ""connecting people, who share and exchange the knowledge and views they have,"" he said.Interactions online may mirror those in the real world, but they are not perfect reflections, he said.They could become even more imperfect as reliance on the internet means users gravitate to only a few major service providers, and those platforms' user agreement and rules become, in effect, the rules of society, Huang cautioned.According to the center's annual Taiwan Internet Report for 2019, 79.2 percent of those surveyed between September and November last year used online social media, of whom 98.9 percent used Facebook, 38.8 percent used Instagram and only 5.6 percent used Twitter.Security concernsBehind the changing of habits seen during the global pandemic, the introduction of fifth generation wireless technology (5G) could also profoundly affect user habits by offering accessible, fast internet access at an affordable price.But its arrival has posed a challenge to Taiwan's government that may dominate the debate over cyberspace in the post-COVID-19 world -- balancing an open ecosystem with security concerns.In terms of 5G, the existing internet environment could make it easy for just a few companies to become dominant players, and they may be foreign and even hostile to Taiwan's interests. That has led Taiwan's government to intervene in the 5G arena by banning the use of essential equipment from certain suppliers or countries, especially China, on the grounds of national security, Huang said.Such fears have extended into other areas, including to internet services, he said, citing the example of China-based video-conferencing service Zoom, which has soared in popularity during the pandemic but was banned in Taiwan for government and school use over security concerns.Yet the government has not been as interventionist in other social or commercial domains, Huang said, citing the example of the growing popularity of foreign online streaming services that are full of content from China.The TWNIC report found that 84.5 percent of those surveyed watched online video or streamed content, 76.3 percent of which was produced in Taiwan, followed by China (42.2 percent), the United States (38.2 percent), Japan (35.2 percent), South Korea (34.4 percent) and Europe (13.2 percent).Striking a balance between free speech and China's attempts to use cultural power to spread its message in Taiwan will not be easy for the government, Huang said.Personal protectionMeanwhile, Huang warned that we all, at some level, will have to be prepared for the pitfalls of being heavily reliant on the online world.Shutdowns of service ""have happened and could still happen, and the impact on us will only increase because the time we spend and our reliance on internet services is growing,"" he said.""When using online services, people need to think ahead and have a plan B in case a company shuts down operations. Everyone should back up data routinely, update online accounts, update passwords, and not allow cookies when browsing online when they are not necessary,"" he advised.Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005220009

5/22/2020,Global support for Taiwan at record high: former U.S. official,"Washington, May 21 (CNA) Randall G. Schriver, a former United States assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said Thursday that Taiwan has won huge global support because of its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, despite China's suppression.""Taiwan's international recognition, international admiration for Taiwan, international support for Taiwan has almost never been higher, because we see the juxtaposition of how the PRC has handled the coronavirus and how Taiwan has,"" Schriver said at a virtual conference hosted by the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.Schriver also berated China for poaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies and seeking to exclude Taiwan from global bodies like the World Health Organization.The Communist Party of China's ""approach to Taiwan has failed, not by my measure but by their own measure,"" he said in the forum, titled U.S.-Taiwan Relations and Taiwan's Evolving Role in the Global Order.As a result of China's failed policies, it has destroyed any pathway for what it calls peaceful reunification and any remaining constituency for a future ""one China,"" Schriver said.China's proposed 'one country, two systems' unification framework ""never had much of a constituency in Taiwan, but polls now regarding what aspirations people have for a future arrangement ... have never been worse from China's perspective,"" he said. ""So it is very difficult to see re-sinification of Taiwan through peaceful means.""In light of that situation, Schriver said, the U.S. should be concerned about a growing temptation on the part of China to use more military tools and coercion against Taiwan.Under such circumstances, the U.S. and Taiwan should strengthen cooperation in the field of information sharing, he said, adding that he supports U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to help boost its defense capability.Also at the forum, Evan Medeiros, Penner Family chair in Asian studies and the Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations, said it is becoming more difficult for the U.S. to strike a balance in supporting Taiwan while seeking to build a constructive relationship with China, given that China is growing more confident in East Asia, and Taiwan is facing increasing pressure and coercion from Beijing.Medeiros said the U.S. should take its security pledge to Taiwan seriously, sell Taiwan more weapons based on the Taiwan Relations Act, and help Taiwan join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Chin-yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005220011

5/22/2020,"Torrential rains to ease Saturday, but threat remains: CWB","Taipei, May 22 (CNA) The torrential rainfall that drenched Taiwan on Friday could ease up on Saturday, but heavy rainfall could still affect the central and southern parts of the country, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) warned.Taiwan is likely to see less rainfall over the weekend as the plum rain front that brought the deluge moves south toward the Bashi Channel and southeasterly winds weaken, forecasters said.According to the CWB, northern Taiwan and low-lying areas in central Taiwan should see milder weather, though they could still get heavy rain, defined by the CWB as more than 80 millimeters of rainfall over a 24 hour-period or 40 mm of rainfall in one hour.Mountainous areas in central Taiwan and low-lying areas in southern Taiwan could see extremely heavy rain, which the CWB defines as more than 200 mm of rainfall over a 24 hour-period or over 100 mm in three hours.In the south, mountainous areas in Chiayi County and some low-lying areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung could even see torrential rain, equal to more than 350 millimeters of rainfall over a 24-hour period, the bureau said.In mountainous areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, ""extreme torrential rain"" of more than 500 mm of rainfall could fall over a 24-hour period, the bureau forecast.Meanwhile, lightning, strong gusts, rock falls, mudslides and flooding are likely islandwide, according to the CWB.On Friday, some schools and offices were closed, and flooding and traffic disruptions were reported around Taiwan due to the inclement weather.Parts of Kaohsiung and Pingtung, where water levels were calf-deep, saw the most severe flooding in Taiwan.The heaviest rainfall was recorded in Sandimen Township in Pingtung, with 550 mm of precipitation accumulated between midnight and 6 p.m. Friday.In northern Taiwan's Hsinchu, rock falls blocked railroad tracks at around noon, causing delays for 1,400 passengers on 10 Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) trains.Several roads, including sections of the Southern Cross-Island Highway in the south, were also closed as a precautionary measure, transportation authorities said.According to the Education Ministry, 26 schools across Taiwan, most of which were in Tainan and Kaohsiung, have reported damage of up to NT$1.59 million (US$53,200) due to the torrential rains.(By Wang Shu-fen, Chen Chao-fu, Chen Chi-chung and Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005220018
5/22/2020,Few mentions of Taiwan in annual speech by Chinese premier: scholars,"Taipei, May 22 (CNA) Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克強) made scant mention of Taiwan in an important annual speech Friday, reflecting China's focus on its economy as it juggles a trade war with the United States and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, according to scholars of cross-strait relations.On Friday morning, Li delivered the government's work report -- a speech often compared to the U.S. state of the union address -- at the opening of China's annual parliamentary meeting, the National People's Congress.The 14,000 word speech was shorter than in previous years, which have averaged around 20,000 words, and also notable in that its references to Taiwan were limited to about 100 words.Tung Li-wen (董立文), an advisory board member at Taiwan Thinktank, told CNA Friday that the relatively minor references to Taiwan in the speech show that China currently has its hands full managing the economic impact of its trade war with the U.S. and the COVID-19 pandemic.As relates to Taiwan, Tung noted that last week China unveiled 11 incentives targeting Taiwanese businesses operating in China, showing that the country needs to retain Taiwanese talent and technology amid the tough economic climate.Chang Yu-shao (張宇韶), deputy secretary of the Cross-Strait Policy Association, characterized the language on Taiwan in the speech as ""soft in tone, but not without its jagged edges.""Li did not invoke political concepts such as ""one country, two systems"" or the ""1992 consensus"" in reference to Taiwan, and instead relied on broader appeals to Chinese nationhood, Chang said.At the same time, the speech omitted the word ""peaceful"" in its reference to ""national reunification,"" he said.The speech's more hardline content came in the announcement of new national security legislation for Hong Kong, though this also contained a sort of implicit threat to Taiwan, Chang said.Meanwhile, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded to Li's speech Friday with language from President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) recent inaugural address.In a statement, the MAC rejected China's ""one country, two systems"" model for ""downgrading Taiwan and undermining the cross-strait status quo.""Instead, it urged Beijing to accept Tsai's principles of ""peace, parity, democracy and dialogue"" as the foundation for cross-strait interaction.(By Lai Yen-hsi and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005220019
5/22/2020,Taiwan's COVID-19 vaccine could begin human trials this fall: VP,"Taipei, May 22 (CNA) A vaccine Taiwan's National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) is developing for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will enter human trials as early as this autumn, Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) disclosed Friday.Lai made the announcement in a Facebook post after visiting the NHRI's Animal Biological Safety Level 3 (ABSL-3) laboratory in Chunan in Miaoli County to see how work on a vaccine was progressing.In April, NHRI President Liang Kung-yee (梁賡義) revealed that a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by the national health research institution had produced promising results in mice.The NHRI has been working on developing four kinds of vaccines against COVID-19 since February, with the development of a peptide vaccine progressing the fastest, Liang told CNA.Peptides are a chain of amino acids that are the building blocks that form proteins.In his post, Lai likened the COVID-19 fight to a baseball game, describing Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) as the starting pitcher who keeps opponents in check for much of the game.The NHRI will be the closer, because the moment it successfully develops drugs and vaccines against the coronavirus, the game will be over, Lai wrote.Lai also praised the NHRI for its previous vital roles in helping the government contain the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and that of avian influenza in 2005.(By Wen Kuei-hsiang and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/culture/202005220020
