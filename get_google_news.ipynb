the pinch of the global COVID-19 pandemic in April, as an index gauging sentiment among manufacturers fell to its lowest level in 11 years, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) said Monday.The April composite index on manufacturing sector sentiment fell 0.8 points from a month earlier to 81.75, the lowest level since January 2009, when the index stood at 70.99.If there was a bright spot, it was that the month-on-month fall in the April index of 0.8 points was less steep than the 6.28-point plunge in March, likely because of optimism that the reopening of economies around the world will boost demand, the think tank said.Gordon Sun (孫明德), director of TIER's Economic Forecasting Center, said the index may have bottomed out in April because Taiwan's manufacturing sector has shown signs of stabilizing.Meanwhile, in a TIER survey conducted in April, 24.8 percent of manufacturers thought their business would improve over the next six months, up from 18.1 percent in a similar poll conducted in March, while 34.9 percent of them said their business would get worse over the next six months, down from 40.5 percent in the March survey.The survey also found, however, that 21.7 percent of respondents said their business improved in April from a month earlier, down from 27.2 percent in the March poll, and 54.3 percent said business got worse, up from 35.3 percent in the March poll, the TIER said.Meanwhile, the composite index to gauge business sentiment in the local construction industry also fell 1.43 points in April from a month earlier to 84.36, hurt by the weakening of economic activity due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the TIER said.But with the spread of the virus seemingly contained in Taiwan and the low interest rate environment well entrenched, property developers were more optimistic about their business prospects over the next six months, the TIER said.As for the service sector, the composite index rose 0.4 from a month earlier to 82.37 in April as rules governing social activities were gradually eased and the government launched stimulus measures to boost consumption, the TIER said.(By Pan Tsu-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls\", 'url':

stayed on the sidelines waiting to see how tensions between Washington and Beijing play out after China unveiled plans to impose national security laws on Hong Kong to tighten its grip on the

The remaining masks will then be open for domestic purchase or export, CNA reported.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Economic Affairs is also planning to meet with mask manufacturers on Tuesday (5/26) to discuss how requisition orders will work and how to coordinate among producers.\\n\\nWang, who also serves as the Central Epidemic Command Center's (CECC) materials acquisition head, said that mask sales between May 7 and May 20 from pharmacies and local health departments averaged 5.7 million a day, while sales from convenience stores and other channels averaged 1.27 million, meaning total daily demand among the public is around 6.97 million.\\n\\nWang said that after adding in masks used by healthcare workers, civil servants and industrial workers, Taiwan's daily demand does not exceed 10 million. She also said as the outbreak continues to stabilize and the weather starts to warm up, demand will decline even further.\\n\\nShe also said that the 8 million masks to be requisitioned per day are reasonable considering the government currently has between 200 to 300 million masks stockpiled.\\n\\nWang also mentioned that Taiwan's daily production capacity of 20 million masks is currently possible due to help from the national army. Once they return back to their original duties, production capacity is expected to decline, unless manufacturers hire more workers.\\n\\nAccording to Wang, many mask manufacturers already have foreign orders for Taiwan made masks. She said that all the official documents for lifting the export ban are ready and will be issued once the CECC gives its final approval.\",\n  'url':

in April, as an index gauging sentiment among manufacturers fell to its lowest level in 11 years, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) said Monday.The April composite index on manufacturing sector sentiment fell 0.8 points from a month earlier to 81.75, the lowest level since January 2009, when the index stood at 70.99.If there was a bright spot, it was that the month-on-month fall in the April index of 0.8 points was less steep than the 6.28-point plunge in March, likely because of optimism that the reopening of economies around the world will boost demand, the think tank said.Gordon Sun (孫明德), director of TIER's Economic Forecasting Center, said the index may have bottomed out in April because Taiwan's manufacturing sector has shown signs of stabilizing.Meanwhile, in a TIER survey conducted in April, 24.8 percent of manufacturers thought their business would improve over the next six months, up from 18.1 percent in a similar poll conducted in March, while 34.9 percent of them said their business would get worse over the next six months, down from 40.5 percent in the March survey.The survey also found, however, that 21.7 percent of respondents said their business improved in April from a month earlier, down from 27.2 percent in the March poll, and 54.3 percent said business got worse, up from 35.3 percent in the March poll, the TIER said.Meanwhile, the composite index to gauge business sentiment in the local construction industry also fell 1.43 points in April from a month earlier to 84.36, hurt by the weakening of economic activity due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the TIER said.But with the spread of the virus seemingly contained in Taiwan and the low interest rate environment well entrenched, property developers were more optimistic about their business prospects over the next six months, the TIER said.As for the service sector, the composite index rose 0.4 from a month earlier to 82.37 in April as rules governing social activities were gradually eased and the government launched stimulus measures to boost consumption, the TIER said.(By Pan Tsu-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls\",\n  'url':

hunters bought into select market heavyweights, especially in the bellwether electronics sector, dealers said.Turnover remained thin, however, as many investors stayed on the sidelines waiting to see how tensions between Washington and Beijing play out after China unveiled plans to impose national security laws on Hong Kong to tighten its grip on the territory, dealers added.The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), the Taiex, closed up 60.03 points, or 0.56 percent, at 10,871.18, after moving between 10,719.25 and 10,874.54.Turnover was NT$146.074 billion (US$4.87 billion).The market opened up 1.79 points and quickly moved higher within minutes before tumbling to the day\\'s lows in the next half hour amid continued concerns over U.S.-China ties, dealers said.Buying then re-emerged, pushing the market into positive territory in the afternoon and to nearly the day\\'s high at the close as investors rushed to pick up large tech stocks and select financial shares.\"I think local investors were the ones driving today\\'s gains as foreign institutional investors remain wary of more volatility in global markets at a time of rising U.S-China tensions,\" Ta Chan Securities analyst Jerry Chen said.Despite the gains in the Taiex, foreign institutional investors were net sellers of NT$4.57 billion in shares Monday, according to the TWSE.After a 1.79 percent plunge Friday, \"local investors tended to take advantage of the battered stocks, with big tech stocks in focus,\" Chen said.In the electronics sector, which rose 0.66 percent to 478.61, integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. rose 4.07 percent to close at NT$460.00, and passive electronics components supplier Yageo Corp. closed 1.21 percent higher at NT$376.00.Bucking the upturn, contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, ended unchanged at NT$292.00.Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which assembles smartphones for Apple and other brands, also closed unchanged at NT$73.60.Bargain hunting also helped the financial sector gain 0.21 percent to close at 1,221.70, with CTCB Financial Holding Co. closing up 1.02 percent at NT$19.75, and Yuanta Financial Holding Co. finishing 0.93 percent higher at NT$16.30.In the old economy sector, China Steel Corp., the largest steel maker in Taiwan, rose 0.26 percent to close at NT$19.65, and Eclat Textile Corp. gained 1.87 percent to end at NT$300.00.\"The Taiex closed above the 20-day moving average of 10,829 today, making further gains possible in the near term,\" Chen said. \"But any upturn will be capped amid concerns over the regional political unrest,\" Chen said.(By Frances Huang) Enditem/ls',\n  'url': 'https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005250012'},\n
