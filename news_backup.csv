03/1/2020,"Taipei, March 1 (CNA) A woman who was evacuated from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has been diagnosed to become Taiwan's 40th confirmed COVID-19 coronavirus case, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said Sunday.The newest patient is a woman in her 70s who lives in northern Taiwan, the CECC said.The woman boarded the cruise ship Jan. 20 and was originally diagnosed with coronavirus Feb. 15 after the ship was quarantined off Yokohama since Feb.4, even though she did not show any respiratory issues, the CECC said.She was hospitalized in Japan Feb. 16 and then returned to Taiwan Feb. 26 after two tests showed she was negative for the virus, the CECC said.Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), CECC chief, said the woman wore a mask the whole time on the flight and was separated from other passengers with nobody sitting within two rows in front of or behind her.After disembarking from her flight she was taken by ambulance to be quarantined at a hospital, with the latest test result showing her to be positive for the coronavirus, Chen said.CECC expert Chang Shang-chun (張上淳) said the woman originally showed negative on her first test, then an unconfirmed result on her second test, which was followed by a positive result on her third test.One of the reasons for the negative tests to later turn out to be positive may have been that toward the end of a particular treatment, the virus level may have dropped low, affecting the tests detecting the virus, Chang said.This is why some international reports have shown that people who are believed to be been cured and have been discharged from hospital later turn out to be positive, he said.Meanwhile, three more patients in Taiwan who were infected with coronavirus were discharged from hospital after recovering from the disease, the CECC said Sunday.The discharged patients were a female tourist from China, the wife of a Taiwanese businessman from Wuhan -- the epicenter of the virus -- and an imported case from Macau.This brought the total number of people who have been discharged after being hospitalized for treatment in Taiwan to 12, the CECC said.As of Sunday, there had been 2,192 people suspected of being infected, including 40 confirmed cases, with one death, according to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control statistics. A total of 2,059 people had been cleared of infection, with the remainder awaiting test results while under quarantine.(By Chen Wei-ting, Chang Hsiung-feng and William Yen) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003010008

03/1/2020,"Taipei, March 1(CNA) Minister Without Portfolio Lin Wan-i (林萬億) said Sunday that it would be best to give new functions and implications to the National Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall, seen by some as a symbol of authoritarianism, instead of dismantling it.Lin, tasked with overseeing issues related to the transformation of the hall, made the remarks after renewed calls from families of the 228 Incident victims to dismantle the structure.There is no timetable yet for the fate of the CKS Memorial Hall as the Ministry of Culture(MOC) is still compiling relevant files with relation to the transformation, Lin said, adding that inter-department meetings will be convened for discussion after the MOC submits its recommendation.There are many suggestions regarding the transformation of the memorial hall, issues such as the structure's new name, new functions and how to deal with the late President Chiang Kai-shek's statue, Lin said,Suggestions from the victims' families will be respected, but at the same time, these suggestions should be viable, Lin said.Asked if dismantling the memorial hall is an option considered by the government, Lin reiterated that the best thing to do is to give new functions and positive implications to the structure instead of removing it or deserting it.The CKS Memorial Hall, a 250,000-square-meter tourist attraction in the heart of Taipei, was completed in 1980 in Chiang's memory, former leader of the Republic of China who moved his government to Taiwan in 1949 after fleeing China following his defeat in the Chinese civil war.However, families and relatives of political persecution victims during the martial law period under Chiang have been calling for the dismantling of the memorial hall as they see Chiang as a human rights violator who should not be treated as a national hero.""We all know that the (statue of the) persecutor is inside the structure,"" Liao Ying-hao (廖英豪), grandson of a political victim of the 228 Incident, a civil uprising that began Feb. 28, 1947 that led to a bloody government crackdown, said during a commemorative event Friday.""It remains a stab in the heart for the victims unless the structure is removed,"" he said, urging the government to make a decision soon.Liao described Chiang as the principal culprit of the 228 Incident.On the other hand, Presidential Office spokesman Ting Yun-kung (丁允恭) said Friday that the Legislative Yuan is currently working on a plan to remove the autocratic characteristics of the CKS Memorial Hall.Ting said the government will eventually come up with a solution on the future of the CKS Memorial Hall that can promote social reconciliation and the country's unity.(By Gu Chuan, Wen Kuei-hsiang and Emerson Lim) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003010010
03/1/2020,"Taipei, March 1 (CNA) More than 20 people are now staying at two quarantine hotels in Taipei under an initiative by the city government to house individuals who have to undergo quarantine but do not have a place to stay in Taiwan.The individuals include Taiwanese businessmen who work in China, as well as people traveling from Italy and South Korea to Taiwan, Commissioner Liu Yi-ting (劉奕霆) of Taipei's Department of Information and Tourism said Saturday.None of them have any symptoms of the COVID-19 coronavirus, Liu stressed, and they are paying for their own stays.As part of efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, all individuals entering Taiwan from China, South Korea and Italy have to undergo 14-day home quarantine upon entry.Those in quarantine are not allowed to leave their homes and are subject to daily health checks by their ward chiefs.The Taipei City government has received reports, however, that some visitors have not been permitted to stay at hotels they had booked in advance because they had to undergo quarantine, which spurred the launch of the initiative.Under the plan, individuals who have displayed no COVID-19 symptoms are allowed to stay at these designated quarantine hotels.Those who do have symptoms are awaiting COVID-19 test results, or have had contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients will be placed in medical institutions if they have nowhere to stay in the country.Currently, two hotels that are providing 40 rooms in total are cooperating with the city under the plan, and two more are expected to join next week, Liu said.The hotels have to pass inspections from Taipei's Department of Health, Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Civil Affairs before they can receive such visitors, Liu said.Regarding the name and location of the hotels, Liu said that Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) has not instructed that these information be made public.Liu also stressed that these hotels remain safe for regular guests staying there, as those in quarantine are placed on different floors.Only hotel employees who are in charge of delivering food to and collecting waste from quarantined individuals are allowed to enter the floors they are staying on, he said, and since these individuals are not allowed to exit their rooms, regular guests are perfectly safe.Even if a hotel runs on a central air conditioning system, which neither of the hotels do, it will not contribute to the spread of the disease, Liu said, adding that he has confirmed this with the city's health department.The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, and there is no evidence so far to indicate that it can spread through airborne transmission, Liu said.According to a Department of Health press statement released Feb. 27, no housekeeping is provided to quarantined individuals during their stay. Instead, the hotels provide them with enough towels, bedsheets and pillowcases in their rooms, as well as cleansing products.When these individuals check out, amenities including shower gels, toothbrushes and slippers will be immediately disposed of, and cleaning staff will be outfitted with masks, gloves and goggles when disinfecting the rooms, the statement said.(By Chen Yi-hsuan, Liang Pei-chi and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003010011

Initially, it plans to test 10 animal samples daily and expand its testing capacity further depending on the development of the epidemic.However, the COA stressed there is no evidence that pets can become infected or transmit the virus.It advised pet owners to follow proper sanitation and hygiene habits, such as washing hands thoroughly after touching their pets, and to help their pets stay healthy.(By Chang Hsiung-feng and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003010007

03/2/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB) announced on Monday (March 2) that it has successfully completed the synthesis of favilavir, a drug that could be potentially used to treat Wuhan coronavirus,

The DCB said that in the future, it would work with cGMP manufacturers to produce sufficient antiviral drugs for patients, according to a CNA report.

DCB deputy director Chuang Shih-hsien (莊士賢) said that the center focused on synthesizing favilavir, which was developed by a Japanese pharmaceutical company and approved for sale in Japan in March 2014. The drug is mostly used to treat flu patients who do not respond to Tamiflu and Relenza Rotadisk, the report said.

Favilavir has been used by both Japan and China to treat severe cases of COVID-19, and the DCB team expects it to become a significant drug in treating the disease, according to the report.

DCB president Herbert Wu (吳忠勳) said that the center was able to synthesize the drug in four days after acquiring its components and that the goal is to transfer the process to domestic companies so they can mass-produce a generic version to fight the epidemic, per CNA.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3884063
03/2/2020,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) The Netherlands Trade and Investment Office in Taiwan (NTIO), which represents Dutch interests in the country in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, said Monday it will fund a program to cultivate local talent for Taiwan's offshore wind energy development.At a news conference, Guy Wittich, head of the NTIO, said based on the good relationship between the Netherlands and Taiwan, the Dutch government approved a talent cultivation program at the end of 2019.Under the program, Wittich said, the Dutch government will fully fund the training of trainers in Taiwan by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), the Wind Energy Institute at the Delft University of Technology, and Water Research Institute Deltares.Wittich said with Taiwan's first offshore wind farm becoming operational last year, renewable energy development in the country has entered a new stage.Efforts to cultivate talent have become critical to the offshore wind energy industry in Taiwan, the NTIO said, which is why it has teamed up with National Taiwan University (NTU) and the Metal Industries Research & Development Centre (MIRDC) to carry out the program.The NTIO said National Cheng Kung University and National Sun Yat-sen University are also likely to take part.According to the NTIO, more than 10 Dutch companies, most of them in the marine engineering industry, have invested in Taiwan and these investors, recognizing the lack of local talent, suggested the Dutch government should set up a talent cultivation program locally.In the first stage, the program will cultivate 20 trainers, the office said.The office did not disclose the size of the funding the Dutch government will provide.In response to the program, Weng Su-chen (翁素真), chief secretary of the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), said the MOEA is planning to set up an offshore wind energy training center in Kaohsiung at the end of this year and she hopes trainers from the Dutch talent cultivation program will join the training center, which aims to cultivate about 500 trainees in the initial phase.According to a recent survey conducted by the NTU Energy Research Center, Taiwan will need about 20,000 offshore energy development professionals by 2025.

03/2/2020,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) The number of workers on unpaid leave in Taiwan rose sharply to 1,604 in the last two weeks of February, due mainly to the effects of the novel coronavirus outbreak on the economy, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) said Monday.As of Feb. 29, the number of workers who had agreed to go on furlough jumped by 735 to 1,604, compared with 869 in the first two weeks of February, according to MOL statistics.Meanwhile, the number of employers implementing unpaid leave also increased in the second half of February, spiking from 22 in the previous two weeks to 40, the MOL data showed.During the 15-day period, three employers ended their unpaid leave programs, but 21 others launched new programs agreed upon by management and employees, bringing the total to 40, the data showed.More than 50 percent of the companies with employees on unpaid leave in the last two weeks of February were businesses in the metal/electromechanical industry, including the manufacturers of parts and components and machine tools, according to Huang Wei-chen (黃維琛), deputy director of the MOL's Department of Labor Standards and Equal Employment.Most of the companies implementing unpaid leave are small enterprises with a workforce of fewer than 50 people, and their unpaid leave programs typically last for less than three months, with their employees each agreeing to take up to four days of unpaid leave per month, according to the MOL.The latest figures reflect the effects of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on the country's tourism/hospitality, restaurant and catering, and wholesale and retail industries, Huang said.The MOL said, however, that employers have been instructed to pay their furloughed employees at least NT$23,800 (US$795) per month, which is the minimum wage, so that the workers can maintain their living standards.The ministry's Workforce Development Agency has in place a program to subsidize companies that offer on-the-job training to furloughed workers to upgrade their job skills, he said.Under the program, employers can apply for subsidies to hold training sessions, with each employee eligible to receive NT$158 per hour for attending a maximum 120 hours of training per month, according to Huang.(By Chang Hsiung-feng and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003020014
03/2/2020,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) A public health expert on Monday advised people to embrace social distancing measures to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.While the number of confirmed diagnoses of the acute respiratory disease are rising around the world, Taiwan can help minimize the threat by applying social distancing as used in other countries, said Chen Hsiu-hsi (陳秀熙), vice dean of National Taiwan University's College of Public Health, during a press conference in Taipei.One such approach is to keep a distance of at least one meter between people as practiced in Finland, he said, adding that even when Finns line up at the bus stop, they still keep roughly that distance between each other.""I had a chance to be a visiting professor in Finland in the past and it was very interesting,"" Chen said. ""If there was a free seat next to someone on the bus, Finnish people would rather go sit somewhere else further away.""Chen said the social distancing model could be a good idea for people in Taiwan and other countries to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.South Korea reported over 800 new coronavirus cases Saturday and one of the main reasons is because a church sect in the country's south-eastern Daegu City tightly packs worshippers into its religious services, Chen said.It is not advisable to hold large scale activities at this point in time, but if an event must be held, there are ways to decrease the risk, Chen said.In addition to screening people for fever, event-goers who have a questionable travel history or history of contact with possible infection carriers should be placed at the back which is better ventilated.""If we implement this method in a mathematical model of the scenario involving the church sect in South Korea, the 800 infections drop to a much lower number,"" he said.South Korea has been under international media scrutiny as one of the hardest hit countries outside China -- the origin of the virus -- with another 476 new coronavirus cases reported Monday, hiking its national tally to 4,212 and also increasing the death toll to 22, according to Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics.Meanwhile, in Taiwan as of Sunday, 2,291 people have been suspected of being infected, including 41 confirmed cases, with one death, according to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control statistics.

03/2/2020,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) The offshore Penghu archipelago is more strategically important than the former frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, a Taiwanese scholar recently said, while calling on the government to bolster Penghu's defenses to prevent a Chinese invasion as losing the islands would imperil the whole country.In a paper titled, ""the Strategic Role of Penghu in the Defense of Taiwan,"" released late January, Paul Huang (黃恩浩), an assistant research fellow at the government-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), called on the nation's armed forces to beef up Penghu's defenses, which play a crucial role in the defense of the country.According to Huang, Penghu or the Pescadores are an archipelago of 90 islands in the Taiwan Strait, and have long been a strategic location, with the Dutch, French and Japanese all launching campaigns against the islands since the 17th century.From an international political point of view, Penghu is the first-line of defense in the so-called ""first-island chain,"" which refers to the major archipelagos on the East Asian continental coast that comprise the Kuril Islands, the Japanese archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the northern Philippines and Borneo.Their strategic location means the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) would have to take the islands in any invasion of Taiwan.According to Huang, Penghu is far more important for Taiwan's defense than the islands of Kinmen and Matsu.Due to their proximity to China, it would be extremely difficult for Taiwan to defend Kinmen and Matsu, which at the closest point are only 2km from China's Fujian Province, Huang said.In contrast, Penghu, which is about 140km from China, has a more strategic role to play in Taiwan's defense, he added.The archipelago is already the most heavily-guarded of Taiwan's offshore islands, according to Huang. Currently, Taiwan has stationed troops on 16 of Penghu's 90 islets.Around 70 of the military's 460 M60A3 tanks are deployed in Penghu, with a Kidd-class destroyer at sea, which could be armed with the RIM-66 Standard missile system, while the islands' air defenses are boosted by Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) jets as well as the Tien Kung surface-to-air defense missile system.Should Chinese military vessels invade, troops in Penghu can also fire Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles, he added.In addition, the 300km range of the radar station at Shiyu Township in Penghu allows early detection of PLA aircraft and vessel movements in the area, covering most of the Taiwan Strait and southeastern coastal areas of China.Huang warned that the loss of Penghu in the event of a cross-strait military crisis could jeopardize the security of the whole nation.As Taiwan is taking steps to build its own submarines, Huang called on the military to deploy submarines in the waters around Penghu in the future to further deter Chinese invasion, which would also help prevent the PLA from crossing the ""first-island chain.""Huang's paper was published on Jan. 21 in the 151st edition of the INDSR's Defense Situation Monthly.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003020023

""But in this year's survey, only 10.75 percent of the respondents said the trade dispute has had a large impact on their business.""""Nearly half of the respondents said that the overall impact on Taiwan so far has been mainly positive, due to the return of manufacturing operations from China.""Asked at a press conference Wednesday why the optimism level of U.S. businessmen in Taiwan was higher than last year considering the threats of the coronavirus, C.W. Chin (金奇偉), AmCham Taipei chairman, said that the timing of the poll could be a factor.The survey was conducted at the start of the outbreak and the government has been doing well in controlling the spread of the virus, he said, adding that the handling of the situation had boosted the chamber members' confidence.While commending the government for its controlling of the outbreak, Chin said the impact of the coronavirus crisis to Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) remains to be seen.About 73 percent of the respondents who completed the survey before the seriousness of the outbreak was recognized expressed confidence about the 12-month outlook, but the rate dropped to 53 percent for those who took the survey after the epidemic became evident, according to the report.The survey also found out that more than 30 percent of AmCham Taipei member companies expect to increase employment in 2020 and fewer respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the level of attention that business receives from top policymakers in Taiwan.On the other hand, the respondents identified cross-Taiwan Strait relations, energy policy, labor regulations on working hours and conclusion of a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S. as top priorities in President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) second term.Most AmCham Taipei members see that better cross-strait relations would be beneficial to the business environment, so this could be an initiative for Tsai to work on, Chin said.The survey was conducted Jan. 14 - Feb. 17, receiving 197 effective responses.AmCham Taipei will come up with its White Paper in June, stating its members' concerns and recommendations to the Taiwan government on economic issues.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003040015

03/4/2020,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Taiwan economists said Wednesday that the central bank should maintain its monetary policy in the second quarter, implying that the bank should not follow the United States Federal Reserve's emergency move the previous day to cut interest rates in an effort to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.Lo Wei (羅瑋), chief economist of Fubon Financial Holding Co, said Taiwan has been doing better than many other countries to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, therefore, it is unnecessary for the local central bank to ease its monetary policy anytime soon.""It would be best if Taiwan's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged for the time being,"" Lo said, ahead of the bank's quarterly policymaking meeting on March 19.In its last quarterly meeting on Dec. 16, 2019, the central bank maintained its monetary policy for the 14th consecutive quarter, leaving the discount rate at 1.375 percent, rates on accommodations with collateral at 1.750 percent, and rates on accommodations without collateral at 3.625 percent.On Tuesday, the Fed made an emergency decision to cut its key interest rates by 0.50 percentage points, joining a growing list of central banks worldwide that have been easing their monetary policies to combat the economic risks posed by the COVID-19 outbreak.""In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate,"" the Fed said, announcing its first emergency action since December 2008 during the global financial crisis.Wang Jiann-chyuan (王健全), vice president of Taiwan's Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER), said the recent heavy losses on the U.S. equity markets reflected panic selling among investors, who are deeply concerned about the effects of the epidemic on the economy.Apparently, the Fed felt a sense of urgency to lower interest rates as a stimulus measure and to prevent weakening of the economic fundamentals amid the COVID-19 escalation, Wang said.In Taiwan, however, the market remains awash in liquidity, so there is no need for its central bank to take similar action, according to Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su (蘇見文).""Many enterprises in Taiwan are sitting on large amounts of funds,"" Su said. ""Taiwan's problem is that enterprises lack good investment opportunities.""In similar vein, Lo said lowering interest rates in Taiwan could prompt heavier investment in the local property market, which would lead to overheating.In Taiwan, fiscal stimulus would be a more effective response to the economic effects of the coronavirus, he said.""The government has already proposed a (NT$60 billion) stimulus package to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with the difficulties arising from the virus outbreak,"" Lo said.

03/4/2020,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Several organizations called for an amnesty for illegal migrant workers in Taiwan on Wednesday, saying that excluding them from the epidemic prevention system amid the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak represents a potentially dangerous oversight that undermine efforts to stop the spread of the virus.At a press conference in front of the Legislative Yuan, the Taiwan International Workers' Association (TIWA), amongst others, urged the government not to deport or fine undocumented workers in Taiwan, and to grant them legal status.Only through these measures can the gap in the epidemic prevention system be fixed, the organizations said.The groups were responding to concerns that the nearly 50,000 illegal migrant workers in Taiwan represent a serious loophole in the epidemic prevention system, after an undocumented Indonesian female caregiver was confirmed as Taiwan's 32nd COVID-19 patient.Following her diagnosis, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) sent an official document to New Taipei City government instructing the city to investigate the case, which some interpreted as a sign the government is cracking down on illegal workers.Although the MOL has said the document was simply an administrative procedure, not a crackdown, migrant rights groups have continued to call for an amnesty for undocumented workers so they can seek treatment without fear of deportation during the epidemic.Chen Hsiu-lien (陳秀蓮), a member of the TIWA, said at the Wednesday press conference that during an outbreak, everyone needs to be included in the epidemic prevention system, regardless of their legal status.Taiwan's policies towards undocumented migrant workers, which are limited to deportation, fines, and prohibiting them from being given legal status, Chen said, ensure that even if these individuals have symptoms of COVID-19, they would rather take their chances than seek treatment.The MOL and National Immigration Agency should immediately cancel punishments against illegal migrant workers so they can be included in epidemic prevention measures, Chen said.Huang Tzu-hua (黃姿華), a representative of a caregivers' union based in Taoyuan, said at the press conference that without a national health insurance (NHI) card, undocumented workers are unable to buy masks under the government rationing system, and are therefore already at higher risk of exposure to the virus.She urged the government to review its policies towards these workers and to grant them an opportunity to work legally.Other organizations at the press conference included the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, the Green Citizens' Action Alliance and the Global Workers' Organization, Taiwan.In response to the organizations' demands, the MOL said illegal migrant workers are in violation of the Employment Service Act and the Immigration Act, and if discovered, are deported and barred from working in Taiwan again.For an amnesty to be granted to undocumented migrant workers, the law would need to be amended, which requires a consensus in society, the ministry added.During the COVID-19 outbreak, the MOL will cooperate fully with the Central Epidemic Command Center in promoting epidemic prevention measures to migrant workers, and will continue to focus on encouraging illegal workers to turn themselves in instead of launching a crackdown, the ministry said.The MOL has posted information on COVID-19 in English, Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, and Indonesian on its website to prevent migrant workers from becoming a loophole in prevention efforts, it said.When asked about the issue Wednesday, Minister of the Interior Hsu Kuo-yung (徐國勇) said that the ministry will focus its efforts on encouraging illegal migrant workers to turn themselves in.As to whether such workers could be granted legal status, Hsu said ""the law is the law,"" and they will be dealt with accordingly.According to National Immigration Agency statistics, there are 48,545 undocumented migrant workers in Taiwan, with 290 in detention centers as of the end of January.(By Wang Cheng-chung, Wu Hsin-yun, Wu Jui-chi and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003040014

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As Taiwan's production of face masks is gradually starting to catch up with the massive demand due to panic over the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the ration limit was raised to three per adult and five per child on Thursday (March 5), but long lines were still a problem in some areas.

Nearly a month ago on Feb. 6, the Taiwan government launched a new rationing system for masks that was based on IDs and limited the quantity to two per person per week. As Taiwan ramped up manufacturing with the goal of becoming the second-largest surgical mask producer in the world, production rose to 8.2 million per day last week.

In order to diminish the crowds of people swarming around stores, those whose NHI cards end with odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are restricted to purchasing on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, while those whose cards end with even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) are limited to buying masks on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, with both allowed to make purchases on Sundays.

On Monday (March 2), the country's health authorities announced that a new ration of three masks per adult per week and five per child under the age of 13 would go into effect on Thursday. However, on the first day of the new system, there were still reports of tensions at drug stores as people jostled for their new quota of masks.

A user of the Taiwanese Facebook page Bao Yuan Commune (爆怨公社) on Thursday complained that as she was lining up to buy masks for her daughter, a middle-aged woman wearing a red shirt cut in front of her. Next, another middle-aged woman wearing a blue shirt approached the woman in red, began talking to her, and the two ultimately shared a spot in line.

When the netizen asked the woman in red to step to the back of the line, she snarled ""There's enough masks to go around."" The Facebook user then bitterly wrote, ""When a dama [big aunty] says these kinds of shameless things, you know there is no need to continue communicating. Is it really that hard to stand in line?""

Many netizens were angered by the account:

""She really has thick skin.""

03/8/2020,"Taipei, March 8 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Sunday said DNA testing showed that a Taiwanese woman was most likely infected with the COVID-19 virus while traveling in Egypt last month and not necessarily the source of infection for 12 workers on a Nile cruise.According to the CECC, the female patient, the 39th confirmed COVID-19 case in Taiwan, was traveling with a tour group to Dubai and Egypt from Jan. 29 to Feb. 21.The woman in her 60s who lives in northern Taiwan developed a soar throat and a cough while in Egypt on about Feb. 20. After returning to Taiwan, her symptoms continued to worsen and she was admitted to hospital on Feb. 28. Test results confirmed that she had the coronavirus on Feb. 29.She is currently undergoing medical treatment in an isolation room, CECC added.The CECC has previously said it suspected the woman was infected by the Egyptian tour guide in her tour group.However, Egyptian Health Ministry and World Health Organization officials recently identified the Taiwanese woman as the source of 12 COVID-19 patients, crew members on the Nile cruise ship she took during her Egypt trip.Speaking during a CECC press event Sunday, National Taiwan University (NTU) Department of Microbiology Professor Yeh Shiou-hwei (葉秀慧) said her team has sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of the coronavirus found in the female patient to determine the source of the virus.Yeh said doing a DNA sequencing test on a virus is like doing a ""paternity test"" to determine its source; by comparing its sequence with other coronavirus clades found around the globe.An analysis of genome sequencing of all the 45 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Taiwan shows basically four sub-clades of coronavirus.However, the DNA sequencing of the 39th patient indicates that the virus strain she was infected with has little similarity with the virus strains found in the other Taiwanese patients.It is closer to those found in coronavirus infection samples in Europe, including those in Italy, Brazil and Nigeria, according to Yeh.As such, the results indicate that the Taiwanese patient was not infected with the coronavirus in Taiwan but likely did so during her Egypt trip, which means she was not necessarily the source of the cluster infection among the Egyptian crew members.(By Chen Wei-ting and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003080011

03/9/2020,"Taipei, March 9 (CNA) Several lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called Monday for a name change for Academia Sinica in English and other foreign languages to avoid confusion and help Taiwan gain greater exposure in the international community.The issue was raised in a hearing of the legislative Education and Culture Committee, during which they said such a move could help distinguish Taiwan's highest research institution from the Beijing- based Chinese Academy of Science.""As sinica means Chinese in Latin, the organization should consider altering its name to avoid possible confusion,"" Fan Yun (范雲) urged, adding that it should start discussing the issue as soon as possible to work out a name that fits it better.The institution has used Academia Sinica as its English name since 1928 and it has often caused confusion in other countries, she said.Fan suggested that a localized name using ""Taiwan"" or ""Taiwanica,"" a word she said is frequently used in international scientific and research journals when referring to citrus fruit or butterflies native to the country.""The Legislative Yuan is ready to amend the law if necessary, and once a consensus has been forged in Academia Sinica, Taiwan's society will respect the move,"" she said.Citing the results of a recent survey by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation on the same occasion, Chang Liao Wan-chien (張廖萬堅) said a new high of 83.2 percent of Taiwan's people consider themselves to be Taiwanese (rather than Chinese or Taiwan/Chinese).A name change should help Taiwan win greater global support, he said.Chang Liao's view was echoed by another DPP legislator, Huang Kuo-shu (黃國書), who urged Academia Sinica to address the issue as soon as possible.In response to their inquires, Academia Sinica President James Liao (廖俊智) said the institution is open to discussion on the name change issue, but it is also an issue related to the nation's status, which cannot be solely decided by the organization.Given that it is an extremely complex issue, a written report should be submitted to the committee in six months.(By Flor Wang and Chang Hsiung-feng) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003090017
03/9/2020,"Taipei, March 9 (CNA) The opposition Koumintang (KMT) saw 48-year-old Legislator Chiang Chi-chen (江啟臣) sworn in as its youngest chairman in several decades Monday, who pledged to promote a ""collective leadership"" to initiate interior reforms.The inauguration ceremony was held in the presence of several former chairmen, including Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), Wu Poh-hsiung (吳伯雄) and Wu Den-yih (吳敦義).""The KMT shall not wait for a certain wise leader to make policies any longer,"" said Chiang in an address at the event, but shall act to put together different people's wisdom and collect opinions from all parties involved.What the party needs now is dialogue and collaboration rather than conflict, he elaborated, and he will play the role of a chairman who is able to promote understanding and cooperation between different generations within the veteran party.With this in mind, he therefore has decided to push for a ""collective leadership"" to seek policies that cover as many possible aspects as possible.Chiang further stated that his role as party chairman is to ""listen, collect (different opinions) and turn people's expectations into visions.""For the so-called ""collective leadership,"" Chiang did not give any details in his speech. However, before he registered in early February to run in the March 7 chairman by-election, he proposed the creation of an 11-member ""decision-making platform"" to decide major issues, if elected.Members would include the newly elected chairman, the party's legislative caucus whip, the KMT secretary-general, local mayors and magistrates, as well as other party members and think tank researchers, Chiang said early this year.The platform should be able to react quickly to changes in public opinion and solve problems efficiently, he said, adding that its creation would ensure that more opinions are taken into account when making key decisions.A U.S.-educated politician, Chiang entered politics in 2010 when he was appointed minister of the now-defunct Government Information Office under the Executive Yuan.He won in Taichung in the national legislative elections in January, his third consecutive victory of its kind since 2012, receiving more votes than any other KMT legislative candidate in the 2020 elections.Chiang defeated former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin (郝龍斌), 69, by more than 46,000 votes in the chairman by-election to become the youngest chairman of the KMT since Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正) assumed the office as head of the party in 1926 when he was 39 years old.At that time, the position of the KMT leader was titled ""president,"" instead of ""chairman.""Former Chairman Wu Den-yih stepped down four days after the party's crushing defeat in the Jan. 11 presidential and legislative elections. Critics have blamed the loss on the party's aging leadership and membership structures and outdated cross-Taiwan Strait policy.At a post-presidential election workshop held Jan. 13 in Taipei, Kharis Templeman, adviser to the Project on Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, said the KMT needs younger candidates who can speak the language of people under 40 and its new party chairman needs to focus on a youth strategy.The KMT also needs to adjust its position on key issues related to relations with China, such as the so-called ""1992 consensus,"" due to its seeming detachment from reality, Templeman further said at that time.The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been consistently interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.Since Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took office as president in May 2016, her rejection of the 1992 consensus has led to China suspending official cross-strait dialogue and stopping independent Chinese travelers from visiting Taiwan.Despite these drops in cross-strait interactions, Tsai won her second term in an overwhelming victory in the 2020 election, while her pro-independence DPP took the majority 61 seats in the 113-seat Legislature.(By Liu Kuan-ting and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003090009

Therefore, their residents, mostly senior people, have to travel to other towns or village health centers for their purchases.""Some even have to ride a bicycle for over 10 kilometers"" to buy just three masks, he said.After learning about the dire situation of the seniors, teachers and students with sewing skills initiated the charity campaign to share their care, Huang said.Due to high demand amid the COVID-19 epidemic, the Taiwan government has been requisitioning all masks produced in the country and rationing them to consumers after supplying hospitals and healthcare workers.Under the rationing system that began Feb. 6, anyone can buy disposable surgical masks on Sundays at designated drugstores and pharmacies, once they present their NHI cards, while on the other days of the week, sales are staggered based on the last digit of the ID number on the buyer's NHI card.Each card is limited to a purchase of three masks every seven days.In addition to Yu Da, the production of the mask covers have also been undertaken by some civic groups devoted to care for the underprivileged in cities and counties, including Taichung and Hsinchu County, and in the prisons that provide sewing classes to their inmates.During an informal meeting with the press Feb. 26, Justice Minister Tsai Ching-hsiang (蔡清祥) revealed that mask cover production is being undertaken at several prisons around the nation.This will not only allow inmates to acquire sewing skills but also help ease demand from society, he said.For Taichung City Councilor Chiu Su-chen (邱素貞), sewing mask covers is not a challenge thanks to her fondness of doing needlework as a pastime. ""Such covers can prolong mask lifespan, but they have to be washed every day for hygiene purposes,"" she said.Medical experts have suggested that mask cover users wash their covers every day, and discard the wrapped surgical masks every two to three days, particularly when the weather is hot.Also, people are advised to wear surgical masks without the covers during visits to hospitals or places where the risk of virus transmission is high, such as crowded and confined spaces.Hospitals frequently remind visitors to discard their masks right after leaving, given the risk that the virus could spread through airborne droplets that have landed on used masks.Taiwan Adventist Hospital physician Su Chih-sheng (蘇志盛) said mask covers are a ""nice"" alternative for mass transportation commuters or people who may stay in confined spaces for short periods of time, but definitely not for medical and quarantine personnel.(By Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003110012

Furthermore, Fukushima's agricultural exports are now 1.4 times more than in the period before the disaster, Izumi said.In addition, tourist arrivals in the six prefectures in the region last year were about three times more that before the earthquake, he said.Earlier Wednesday, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) tweeted in Japanese that at 2:46 p.m. (Japan time), she will pray with her Japanese friends for those who perished in the disaster.

When selling set in later, at one point the index plummeted by more than 500 points due to a loss of investor confidence.During the session, nearly 60 stocks fell by the daily maximum cap of 10 percent, triggering heavy selling pressure, especially on high-tech shares -- the mainstay of the domestic bourse.Heavyweight electronics shares, such as Largan Precision Co., Taiwan Semicondcutor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., all suffered heavy losses.Largan, the most expensive stock on the Taiwan stock market and a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., finished 9.24 percent lower to end at NT$3,980.Largan has lost NT$160 million in market value over the past two months, with shares falling 23 percent from their peak of NT$5,210.Due to the spread of the coronavirus that saw some clients in China not re-start operations until after the Lunar New Year holiday, Largan's consolidated revenue in February registered a month-on-month fall of 11 percent and an annual increase of 45 percent to NT$3.673 billion.Hon Hai, the world's largest contract home appliance maker and a major assembler of Apple Inc.'s iPhones, lost 4.96 percent ending the day at NT$74.7, while TSMC, the world's No. 1 contract chipmaker, fell 2.65 percent at NT$294.At a recent online investor conference, Hon Hai said its plants in China have largely resumed business, and the group expects to fully resume normal operations by the end of March.With the COVID-19 crisis rapidly worsening in the U.S. and Europe, global stock markets have been overcome by a growing panic. As a result, the domestic market may continue to sink in the short-term, testing the 10,000-point mark, analysts said.Amid weak investor confidence, the weighted index has dropped by more than 900 points this week, suggesting that even a technical rebound in the short-term will not help recover the losses until there are signs of the pandemic easing, they said.As the short term outlook for Taiwan's market remains pessimistic due to the turmoil on global markets, in particular the U.S. market, it is very likely the domestic market will see its weighted index fall below the 10,000-point mark soon, they forecast.Meanwhile, Frank Juan (阮清華), deputy minister of finance and executive secretary of the National Stabilization Fund, tried to calm investors, saying the fundamentals of the local bourse remain healthy and the authorities are keeping a close eye on developments.He added that the state-owned National Stabilization Fund will enter the market if necessary to prevent excessive market instability.(By Flor Wang, Chung Jung-feng and Han Ting-ting) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003120011

03/13/2020,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) A coalition of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that fight for the rights of migrant workers initiated a petition Friday to urge the government not to detain or deport undocumented migrant workers who seek medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.Gracie Liu (劉曉櫻), director of the Migrants and Immigrants Service Center under the Hsinchu Catholic Diocese, told CNA that the online petition calls for the government not to arrest the undocumented migrant workers because otherwise they could be reluctant to seek treatment for fear of being deported.""The idea is to let them seek medical treatment or consultation and be able to freely leave hospitals and clinics without fear of arrest,"" Liu said.Concerns of a crackdown were raised Feb. 28, when the Ministry of Labor's Workforce Development Agency Deputy Director-General Tsai Meng-liang (蔡孟良) said that a search system worked out in collaboration with the National Immigration Agency (NIA) will soon open to track down undocumented migrant workers in Taiwan.Tsai made the statement after an undocumented female caregiver from Indonesia was confirmed Feb. 26 as the 32nd patient in Taiwan to contract COVID-19. Taiwan currently has 50 confirmed cases of the acute respiratory disease, caused by a new coronavirus, since it emerged from China at the end of last year.The petition also urges the government to abolish penalties and re-entry bans for undocumented migrant workers who wish to return to their country of origin during the pandemic, Liu said.Under current regulations, if an undocumented worker is arrested and deported, then they lose their right to ever work again in Taiwan.In response, Paul Su (蘇裕國), deputy director of the Cross-Border Workforce Management Division under the Labor Ministry's Workforce Development Agency, said that his ministry for the time being will not coordinate any large-scale crackdown on undocumented workers.""However, the abolition of fines, re-entry bans and restoration of documented status needs revision of the current laws, which require consensus in society,"" he said.If a member of the general public makes a report on an undocumented migrant worker, the MOL will still dispatch the local government to investigate, although deportation will be up to the NIA.There were an estimated 48,545 undocumented migrant workers in Taiwan as of the end of January, with 290 in detention centers, according to NIA statistics.The petition was initiated by around a dozen migrant worker organizations, scholars and experts, including the Taiwan International Workers' Association, the Domestic Caretakers Union Taoyuan, Serve the People Association, Taoyuan; Hope Workers' Center and the Hsinchu Migrants and Immigrants Service Center.(By William Yen) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003130019

03/13/2020,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Several individuals across Taiwan have been tracked down for disseminating false information related to the new coronavirus disease COVID-19, law enforcement authorities said Friday.Speaking at a news conference in Taipei, the Criminal Investigation Bureau's (CIB) Third Investigation Corps head Hsiao Juei-hao (蕭瑞豪) said a new immigrant from Indonesia and a man identified only as Ho (何) have been turned over to prosecutors for spreading coronavirus-related fake news.According to Hsiao, the two were caught by the corps following a tipoff that people had been posting groundless information about the spread of the coronavirus on Facebook.After an initial investigation, an Indonesian woman was discovered to have been posting messages on the Facebook page of a group stating that some Indonesian workers infected with the disease were out and about in New Taipei's Shulin District, Hsiao said.Ho, 45, was found meanwhile to have posted a message on his Facebook page claiming that some customers at a famous KTV parlor and a department store in eastern Taipei had tested positive for the virus.Although the new immigrant argued that she translated the message of a friend in Indonesian into Chinese and posted it on Facebook to remind friends and relatives of the situation, and Ho claimed that he just wanted to pass on the ""news"" to other friends after hearing it from a friend, they were both charged with violating the Special Act on COVID-19 Prevention, Relief and Restoration, Hsiao said.In a press release issued that same day, the CIB said that a 30-year-old Tainan citizen surnamed Lee (李) has been charged in line with the act after he was found to have also disseminated misinformation on the Internet.According to the CIB, Tainan police nabbed Lee on a tipoff that someone posted fake news March 11 on a Facebook page stating that the 47th confirmed COVID-19 case -- an office worker in southern Taiwan -- was ""kicked out"" by his company after it found that he had a fever after returning from a business trip to the Netherlands.As what Lee said on the post did not match the information made public by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) about the case, he was accused of spreading misinformation and admitted to having not checked it out beforehand when questioned by Tainan police, it said.According to the CIB, Lee said he learned the information on the Internet and posted it on Facebook to allow his relatives and friends to be aware of the ""news.""Lee has been turned over to the Tainan Prosecutor's Office for further investigation, it said. He could face a jail term of no more than three years or a maximum fine of NT$3 million (about US$100,000).In separate developments, a man surnamed Liu (劉) residing in Taichung, as well as five others from New Taipei, Taoyuan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung who were involved in four cases, were also called in by police for questioning for conducting similar offenses, the Investigation Bureau told a news conference later Friday.(By Flor Wang, Liu Chien-bang and Hsiao Po-wen) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003130021

His diagnosis was confirmed on Saturday, and he is also being treated in a negative-pressure isolation room in hospital, the CECC said.So far, the CECC said, it has identified 15 people who came in contact with the 53rd patient, and is still tracing his movements in the period after he returned to Taiwan.The CECC thinks that all three cases were imported, based on the patients' travel history and when they began to show symptoms, Chen said.Meanwhile, the CEEC now requires all passengers arriving from 27 European countries, including the United Kingdom, to remain in home quarantine for 14 days, in light of the escalation of the outbreak in Europe, he said.At a press conference last week, Chen said Europe was likely to be hit by a ""second wave"" of COVID-19 cases, with the number soon surpassing those in Asia.(By Wu Hsin-yun, Chang Ming-hsuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003140009

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Haiti expelled the Taiwanese ambassador over “a small incident” but is nevertheless planning to maintain diplomatic relations, Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste reported Thursday (March 12).

The French-speaking Caribbean nation is one of 15 remaining diplomatic allies following relentless Chinese efforts to restrict Taiwan’s international space. The new agency quoted the country’s foreign minister, Claude Joseph, as saying that it was awaiting the replacement of Taiwanese Ambassador Bernard Bang-zyh Liu (劉邦治).

The minister was quoted as saying the incident was “a matter of national sovereignty” and ""had been rapidly resolved.” The incident reportedly occurred in early January at the private residence of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse.

According to UDN, Liu and Moïse had a quarrel, after which Haiti demanded the diplomat leave the country within 72 hours. The appointment of a new ambassador was also demanded, and Taiwan’s interests have since then been managed by a chargé d'affaires.

Joseph emphasized the relationship between the two countries remains “intact” despite the incident. “There is an interesting, cordial relationship between Haiti and Taiwan,” he told Le Nouvelliste.

In Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Liu returned home on official business and that communication between the two governments was normal, with joint projects proceeding as planned. Liu served in Haiti from 2010 to 2014 and again since late last year.

Le Nouvelliste noted that the ambassador had been working on several projects, especially in the field of agricultural cooperation. A decision on a US$150 million (NT$4.5 billion) Taiwan loan for investment in Haiti’s electricity sector had not been reached after the Caribbean country’s parliament suspended operations in January amid political unrest.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3897143

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The de facto American embassy in Taiwan announced on Sunday (March 15) that the U.S. will work with Taiwan in the research and development of vaccines and medicine to counter the coronavirus, which has infected over 150,000 globally.

The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said in a statement that it will cooperate with Taiwan’s Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in the war against the Wuhan virus (COVID-19). It lauded the island country’s extensive experience in infectious disease prevention and its successful efforts to curb the potentially deadly virus.

The move signifies great strides in the bilateral relationship between Taiwan and the U.S. while at the same time demonstrating that Taiwan is an indispensable contributor to global health, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

Taiwan has drawn worldwide acclaim for its response to the pandemic, having been praised as a role model by many media outlets around the world.

In addition to timely border control and technology-based face mask rationing systems, Academia Sinica, Taiwan’s leading research institute, has developed antibodies for a 15-minute COVID-19 test that it hopes will help contain the relentless march of the coronavirus. Taiwan also received the green light last month to join the U.S. in starting clinical trials for antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for the novel virus.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3897535

In an interview with the talk radio network Newstalk ZB, Ardern said that the country's officials are banning public gatherings of 500 people or more, including musical festivals and events that are expected to attract large crowds. She pointed out that the New Zealand government has been looking to different countries to gain a better grasp on containing the virus, reported Storm Media.

Ardern said the government has been following Taiwan in advising cancellation of educational institutions and crowded gatherings, which is why schools in New Zealand have not yet been suspended.

(TSMC), after the company's American depositary receipts (ADRs) fell 14 percent the previous day, dealers said.The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) ended down 278.14 points, or 2.86 percent, at 9,439.63, after moving between 9,371.35 and 9,677.07, on turnover of NT$236.06 billion (US$7.82 billion).The market opened down 1.84 percent and remained weak, with a focus on TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock on the local market, and other large cap stocks.As the decline extended to heavyweights in the financial and old economy sectors, the Taiex plunged more than 340 points to the day's low, before recovering slightly on some bargain hunting, dealers said.The bargain hunting was also sparked by a rebound of Dow futures, signaling a technical rebound of the spot market later in the day, dealers said, adding that government-led funds were among the bargain hunters.The Taiex's sharp drop followed a 12.9 percent dive of the Dow overnight, the steepest decline since the Black Monday market crash in 1987, despite an interest rate cut of 1 percentage point by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Sunday.""Market sentiment has been spooked by the Fed's surprise rate cut, which spurred fears that the COVID-19 impact may be worse than expected,"" Ta Chan Securities analyst Jerry Chen said.In the second emergency rate cut in 15 days, the Feb lowered key interest rates to zero, after a 0.50 percentage point cut on March 3.""Furthermore, U.S. President Donald Trump, who until then had appeared unworried about the coronavirus pandemic, said it might continue into August,"" Chen said.

03/20/2020,"Taipei, March 20 (CNA) The value of orders for exports received by Taiwan-based companies in February fell 18.8 percent from the previous month to US$28.68 billion as global demand was hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Friday.Export orders in February were also down 0.8 percent year-on-year, with the adverse effect of the virus largely offset by an easing of the trade war between China and the United States and strong orders for computer and telecommunications products to support growing 5G and AI sectors, the MOEA said.The orders also reflected shifts in production by Taiwanese businesses in China back to Taiwan because of Beijing's lockdown of many cities to contain the new coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan in late December.According to MOEA statistics, only 40.7 percent of the orders placed with Taiwanese companies in February were shipped from China, the lowest level since June 2006 and a decline of 8.1 percentage points from January.Huang Yu-ling (黃于玲), director of the MOEA's Department of Statistics, said the virus has constrained the operations of Taiwanese companies in China, leading to a 14.8 percent increase in the value of export orders produced in Taiwan in February.Citing the results of a survey of Taiwanese firms, Huang said about 10 percent of the 1,585 companies questioned said they have relocated production lines to Taiwan because of a safer environment here.(By Flor Wang and Wu Po-wei) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003200019
03/20/2020,"Taipei, March 20 (CNA) Taiwan started a three-month amnesty program for foreign nationals who have overstayed their visas, allowing them to pay smaller fines should they decide to report to the immigration authorities during the grace period, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said Friday.At a press conference, NIA Deputy Director-General Bill Chung (鐘景琨) said that the ""Expanded Overstayers Voluntary Departure Program,"" which will run until June 30, comes at a time during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which undocumented migrant workers and general visa overstayers may wish to go back to their countries of origin but are concerned about the penalties they might incur.Under the program, there will be no mandatory detention, while the maximum penalty will be NT$2,000 (US$66) and no re-entry ban, compared with detention, a maximum fine of NT$10,000 and an entry ban of 1 to 8 years for those who do not voluntarily contact immigration authorities, Chung said.""In other words, we won't detain or restrict them from returning to Taiwan at a later date, while minimizing the fine to only NT$2,000, which is the minimum fine if an overstayer is caught,"" he said.He encouraged all overstayers to use the program because the NIA plans to impose heavier penalties after the grace period and to organize a nationwide crackdown after the coronavirus pandemic period subsides, Chung said.The program officially starts on April 1, but amnesty privileges will also be available to those who turn themselves in from Friday, Chung said.According to NIA statistics, one of the largest number of overstaying foreign nationals in Taiwan are migrant workers, who accounted for 48,545 as of the end of January. Of that number, 23,474 were Indonesian, 21,931 were Vietnamese, 2,366 were Filipino, 773 were from Thailand and one from Malaysia.Teddy Surachmat, deputy head of the Indonesian representative office in Taiwan, told CNA that his office will distribute information about the amnesty through online media, and will also utilize the help of other Indonesian migrant workers and community leaders to get the word out to undocumented migrant workers.Surachmat also asked the Taiwan government to test undocumented Indonesian migrant workers who voluntarily contact the immigration authorities for COVID-19 before repatriating them.In response, Chung said that his agency will follow the guidelines set by the Central Epidemic Command Center by measuring temperatures and examining any overstayer to evaluate if there is a need to send such a person for further testing by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control.The program follows on from a similar program conducted from January until the end of June last year, in which over 17,000 overstayers, including more than 9,000 previously undocumented migrant workers who voluntarily contacted immigration authorities were repatriated.An undocumented migrant worker, who wished to remain anonymous, said the amnesty was ""good news,"" but said she will stay and work in Taiwan because she has a family she needs to support.""I will just avoid going out if it's not necessary and take extra care of myself,"" she said.However, she said she is still willing to seek medical help if she develops symptoms that resembles the coronavirus.(By William Yen) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003200006
03/20/2020,"Taipei, March 20 (CNA) A project to build a third terminal at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport has received a major budget boost of NT$16 billion (US$530 million), and is scheduled to be completed in 2026, the airport operator said Friday.The company's board of directors agreed on a total budget of NT$95 billion for the project at a meeting on March 18, including NT$53.7 billion for the main terminal building, said Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Co. (TIAC).Construction of the main building is scheduled to be completed in 2025, with its northern and southern concourses finished in 2024 and 2026, respectively, according to TIAC.That represents a significant delay for the project which started in 2017 and was initially scheduled to be operational by 2021, after several unsuccessful tenders due to low interest from local building contractors.For example, the main building was originally budgeted for NT$22 billion, though that was raised to NT$39.6 billion in 2018 and NT$44.8 billion in 2019 after two and one unsuccessful tenders, respectively.The project was widely criticized for a complicated design by the British architectural firm Rogers Stirk Harbour+ Partners and poor budget management.To fix the problems, TIAC said, it reviewed the project with the designers and decided to remove a huge skylight but keep the featured wavy ceilings and petal-shaped aluminum installations in the terminal.TIAC Senior Vice President Fan Hsiao-lun (范孝倫) said the company will cut costs by introducing more migrant workers, under the Executive Yuan's loosening of related regulations.The company said it will also provide more incentives for contractors, such as utility subsidies and reduction of security deposits, and ask for cross-ministry collaboration to help reduce risks during construction.The new budget will be sent to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications for review, before being submitted to the Executive Yuan for final approval, the company said.Last year, passenger volume at the airport reached 49 million, far exceeding the 35 million passengers the two existing terminals were designed to handle.(By Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003200018
03/20/2020,"Taipei, March 20 (CNA) Human rights abuses continue to occur with concerning regularity on Taiwan's distant water fishing fleets despite the fact the country was removed from the European Union's illegal fishery watch last June, non-governmental environmental organization Greenpeace East Asia said Thursday.Moreover, as one of the seafood traders involved is a major global tuna supplier, it is feared that products tainted by illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and forced labor could be reaching the consumer market, Greenpeace said.""Consumers in the main fish markets have every reason for concern that the seafood they buy may have been caught illegally, mixed with illegal catches or fished by workers subject to poor working conditions and even forced labor,"" said Greenpeace campaigner Pearl Chen (陳珮瑜).Although the Taiwanese government has improved administrative systems to combat IUU under international pressure, Chen said, the organization discovered new evidence during a two-month investigation last summer that both government and corporations are failing to protect migrant fishermen.Greenpeace said in its report that its members visited a port frequented by Taiwanese vessels and interviewed migrant fishermen, all hired from Indonesia, who worked on fishing vessels flagged or otherwise linked to Taiwan.It found that working conditions violated six of the 11 International Labour Organization (ILO) indicators of forced labor, including excessive overtime, withholding of wages and confiscation of identity documents.""We only got to sleep for five hours if and when we caught some fish. If we didn't catch anything, we just have to keep working, even for 34 hours straight. If it were possible, I'd like to change how much time we have to work and rest, to meet the needs of human bodies. There's got to be a way to make it more balanced, just like how people who work on land do it,"" an anonymous fisherman was cited as saying in the report.In addition to poor labor conditions, Greenpeace said, it identified two Taiwanese fishing boats it suspected of shark finning and illegal transshipments, adding that both are business partners of Fong Chun Formosa (FCF), which recently acquired U.S. seafood company Bumble Bee.The group called on FCF, one of the world's top three tuna traders with strong market links in Japan, the Americas and Europe, to take more proactive action, including enhancing the traceability of the seafood supply chain, and strictly upholding international standards on human rights and labor rights.Greenpeace said it submitted the report to Taiwan's Fisheries Agency two weeks ago, and urged it to conduct an investigation.In response, Fisheries Agency Director-General Chang Chih-sheng (張致盛) said it needs time to verify the evidence provided by Greenpeace.Fisheries Agency officials said as Greenpeace did not provide the names of the interviewees or their work history on the vessels accused of engaging in forced labor, for instance, it will have to conduct its own thorough investigation and interview all fishermen on those vessels.The agency stressed that it has handled three forced labor cases over the past few years, and will not tolerate such practices if the accusations are proved to be true.(By Yang Shu-min and Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003200009

""COVID-19 landed at Italy's doorstep as it has at Taiwan's and both sides have been doing their best to deal with the situation.""Another misconception, he said, is possible skepticism over the safety of Italian products, which, he stressed, cannot serve as a possible vehicle of contagion.On a broader scale, while acknowledging that people-to-people mobility in Italy and Taiwan has been affected by the outbreak since January, Giglio said ""it is unreasonable to make unnecessary obstacles to the displacement of goods and to the regular development of bilateral trade.""His comments came after the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) announced on Feb. 19 that Taiwan would prohibit imports of live pigs and pork products from Italy, effective the next day.The move followed an assessment of a growing African swine fever (ASF) epidemic seen in Sardinia.During the interview, Giglio said he was appealing to Taiwan's government to reconsider some recent unilateral decisions that have negatively affected the export of Italian products to Taiwan, particularly in the food sector.Touching on the topic of his office's recent campaign dubbed ""Italy-Taiwan: Healthy Together,"" the Italian representative said the activity is focused on promoting bilateral exchanges of know-how and experiences in the health sector, citing the ongoing university exchanges between Italian and Taiwanese medical teams as an example.""The COVID-19 emergency is a global challenge.

03/21/2020,"Editor's note: For readers' reference, Focus Taiwan compiled useful information of COVID-19 prevention and measures Taiwan has taken to stem outbreakAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the coronavirus disease that originated in Wuhan, China, is caused by a new strain of coronavirus that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease it causes is called COVID-19.Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.Most patients will recover, but some with a history of diseases, such as diabetes, chronic liver and kidney diseases and cardiovascular disease, may die, according to information from China‘s public health departments.The WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11.The WHO Recommends: *Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of the infection include washing hands regularly, covering one’s mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Recommends:*Wash your hands thoroughly with soap*Wear surgical masks when coughing or sneezing*Avoid crowded places, including hospitals*Avoid unnecessary overseas travel Attention: Wearing a surgical mask is a must when:  Visiting medical treatment facilities; presenting symptoms of fever or respiratory problems; having chronic diseases; or being in a confined space where contact with people is unavoidable, such as in an airplane.Washing hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is often more important than wearing masks because the new coronavirus can survive on the surface of objects for as long as five days during droplet transmission, meaning that keeping one’s hands clean is a must.The following are images taken from CDC's official website about how to wash hands properly in Indonesian, Thai and Vietnamese: @ Malay Version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=QoDuUzBEpvc&feature=emb_logo@Burmese Version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=tZZ1OJoSxec&feature=emb_logo Public health experts, meanwhile, advise people to keep a distance of at least 1 meter awayDisinfect the surface of objects people touch often with diluted bleach (1 portion bleach to 100 portion water) or 75% alcoholTo get help if you develop a fever and a cough after returning from COVID-19-circulating countries and areas within 14 days, or have contact with a COVID-19 patient within the period, please call the 1922 hotline.Migrant workers can call the 1955 hotline set up by the Ministry of Labor for relevant information and assistance in Chinese, English, Thai, Indonesian and Vietnamese.Wear surgical masks if you have a fever or other respiratory symptoms, and contact local health authorities by calling the hotlines for assistance. Inform doctors of travel history and possible exposure to the virus, such as for example, being in places where others had symptoms.Since Feb. 6, Taiwan has rationed the sale of face masks. At present, people can buy 3 masks for adults or 5 masks for children every 7 days for NT$5 per mask at designated drugstores and pharmacies by presenting their national health insurance (NHI) card.While sales are open to everyone on Sunday, they are limited based on the last digit of the ID number on the buyer's NHI card on other days of the week – those with odd ID numbers can buy masks on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and those with even numbers can buy masks on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.This restriction only applies to sales of adult masks. Children’s masks can be purchased any day of the week, but purchases are still limited to five masks every seven days. Starting April 9, residents will have access to 9 masks for adults every 14 days, up from three per week at present, while the quota for children's masks will remain at 10 every two weeks.Also, consumers will be able to buy all nine adult masks or all 10 children's masks in one purchase on any day of the week so that they won't have to line up for the masks once a week on specific days depending on whether a person's ID number on their NHI card is odd or even.Moreover, starting April 9, people can send up to 30 masks every two months by mail to their first- or second-degree relatives living in foreign countries.Foreign nationals in Taiwan will not be allowed to do this, however, because the government has no way of confirming who their relatives within a second-degree are. The only exception would be if the relative was a Taiwan national. A government-built masks supply platform at https://mask.pdis.nat.gov.tw/ allows people to search for close-by pharmacies for mask purchases. However, the information is currently only in Chinese.Link to real-time mask map https://mask.goodideas-studio.com/In mid-March, an online system for mask purchases (still limiting purchases to three masks per person every seven days) was launched on a trial basis. Orders can be placed via the government website https://emask.taiwan.gov.tw/msk/index.jsp, or through a National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) mobile app called 健保快易通 in Chinese.To use the online ordering system, consumers either must have access to a card reader or need to download the NHIA app.After logging onto the website, consumers with a card reader linked to their computers will be required to insert either their National Health Insurance (NHI) or Citizen Digital Certificate card to place their order for three masks, the maximum purchase. Each mask is still sold for NT$5 online, but a NT$7 transportation fee will be added to each order.Masks are also being sold at duty-free stores in five airports around Taiwan. Three adult masks or five children's masks are available for NT$50 or US$2. The sale still counts toward Taiwan's mask rationing system, which allows all residents to buy three masks every seven days.News about the new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is being circulated everywhere. While there is plenty of useful and reliable information online, there is also a lot of misinformation.False information includes an online message that encourages people to hoard food and basic household items -- toilet paper the preferred item -- after Taiwan surpassed 100 cases of the new coronavirus March 18.No supply shortage of toilet paper in Taiwan, the government declares. Actions have been taken to crack down on the spread of misinformation on the Internet.The following are a number of false and misleading posts on social media that Robert H. Shmerling, faculty editor of Harvard Health Publishing, singled out in his article, titled “Be careful where you get your news about coronavirus,” on the website https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/be-careful-where-you-get-your-news-about-coronavirus-2020020118801@“Oregano Oil Proves Effective Against Coronavirus,” an unfounded claim@ a hoax stating that the U.S. government had created and patented a vaccine for coronavirus years ago, shared with nearly 5,000 Facebook users@ a false claim that “coronavirus is a human-made virus in the laboratory”@ sales of unproven “nonmedical immune boosters” to help people ward off 2019-nCoV@ unfounded recommendations to prevent infection by taking vitamin C and avoiding spicy foods@ dangerous suggestions that drinking bleach and snorting cocaine can cure coronavirus infection@ a video with useless advice about preventing infection with the new coronavirus by modifying your diet (for example, by avoiding cold drinks, milkshakes, or ice cream). This video, which demonstrates the removal of a parasitic worm from a person’s lip, is many years old and has nothing to do with the current virus.Starting March 19, Taiwan implemented a ban on the entry of most foreign nationals.The only foreign nationals allowed entry are those who hold Alien Resident Certificates (ARCs), or documents proving they are in Taiwan for diplomatic or other official purposes, or to fulfill business contracts, as well as those who have received special permits.All arrivals from overseas — whether they are Taiwanese or foreign nationals — are subject to home quarantine for 14 days. Compensation of NT$1,000 per day will be offered to those who take the initiative to report their travel history. Meanwhile, a three-month amnesty program, TO BE EXPIRED ON JUNE 30, is available for foreign nationals who have overstayed their visas, allowing them to pay smaller fines should they decide to report to the immigration authorities during the grace period.Taiwan imposed highest travel warning on all overseas destinations on March 20, discouraging all non-essential travel to foreign countries.In Taipei, New Taipei and Keelung, ""quarantine hotels"" are open to individuals who are required to undergo quarantine but do not have a place to stay in Taiwan or do not want to stay in their own homes.

03/22/2020,"Taipei, March 22 (CNA) A total of 16 new coronavirus cases, 13 of which originated overseas, were confirmed in Taiwan on Sunday, bringing the total number to 169 since the outbreak began, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said.Among the new patients, three are believed to have contracted the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) locally, said Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC.One of the three, a woman in her 20s, is a nurse at a nursing home. So far, 81 doctors, nurses and residents at the nursing home have been tested for COVID-19, and all have tested negative, according to Chen.Health authorities are now moving five of the 53 patients to a nearby hospital while the rest of the 48 will be sent to two quarantine locations to prevent a further spread of the disease, said Deputy Health Minister Hsueh Jui-yuan (薛瑞元).According to the CECC, the nurse (case 156) has no recent overseas travel history and developed a fever, dizziness and general weakness on March 12.She visited a nearby clinic on March 16 but the medication she received did not alleviate her symptoms and she sought further care at a hospital on March 20.Authorities have identified another 14 people who had contact with her before her diagnosis and is closely monitoring their conditions, according to the CECC.Chen said the CECC has not yet been able to pinpoint the origin of the woman's infection, but he believed the nursing home infection was ""manageable"" as its doctors, nurses and residents have all tested negative for COVID-19 and the home has been closed and disinfected.The two other cases in which the disease was contracted locally (cases 168 and 169) are a German in his 30s and an Austrian in her 30s who are believed to have been infected with the coronavirus from a previous confirmed case (case 124).Both of them were quarantined at home before they tested positive for COVID-19.Meanwhile, of the 13 new imported cases, two of them (cases 161 and 162) were members of a tour group that visited Egypt from March 3 to 12. They two developed symptoms during home quarantines on March 20.These latest additions mean eight members of the tour group and a family member of one of the eight, have so far tested positive for COVID-19. Health authorities are monitoring the health of people they came in contact with on the airplane and after returning to Taiwan, the CECC said.The remaining imported cases showed symptoms of infection between March 7 and March 20 during and after traveling to the U.S., Egypt, Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., Denmark, New Zealand and the Philippines.As of Sunday, 133 of the 169 confirmed cases in Taiwan have been classified as imported, the CECC said.Globally, over 297,207 COVID-19 cases and at least 12,790 deaths had been reported in 165 countries/territories worldwide, according to the CECC.Currently, 28 of the 169 coronavirus patients in Taiwan have been released from quarantine, while two patients have died.

03/22/2020,"Taipei, March 22 (CNA) A ministerial meeting of Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) member economies in August could help Taiwan's bid to join the Japan-led trade initiative, a Taiwanese official told CNA on Sunday.The CPTPP, a trade agreement that arose after the United States pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in January 2017, consists of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.On Saturday, Nikkei Asian Review reported that Japan will make a fresh attempt to expand the trade pact to include more Asian economies, such as Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines.Describing the report as ""good news for Taiwan,"" Minister without Portfolio John Deng (鄧振中) said CPTPP member economies are set to convene a cabinet-level meeting in Mexico this August, and it will be worth watching to see if the inclusion of new members will be on its agenda.The meeting is currently in limbo because of the growing new coronavirus pandemic, but Taiwan's government will continue lobbying for its inclusion with Japan, which plays a leading role in the CPTPP, he said.Taiwan has a longstanding trade relationship with Japan and has long expressed its interest in joining the trade pact, Deng said, citing such efforts as lowering import duties on 15 Japanese agricultural and fishery products, including yams and rice wine.Meanwhile, Roy Chun Lee (李淳), deputy director of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research's Taiwan WTO & RTA Center, said Taiwan can be a plus for CPTPP as it has tens of thousands of capable businessmen scattered around the world.In view of the current situation in which regional integration mechanisms face challenges, and China's economy is at risk of recession due to the U.S.-China trade war and the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, Taiwan's inclusion in the CPTPP could give the group new momentum, Lee argued.The gross domestic product (GDP) of the CPTPP member economies totals US$10.2 trillion, accounting for 13.6 percent of global GDP, while Taiwan's trade with CPTPP member economies accounts for more than one-fourth of Taiwan's external trade value, government data showed.According to the group's executive committee meeting in Tokyo on January 18, 2019, the inclusion of a new member will be decided by consensus.As a practice, an economy that wants to be included needs to file an application and solicit support informally from member economies.(By Liu Pei-cheng and Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003220012
03/22/2020,"Tainan, March 22 (CNA) A retired National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) professor has become the first Taiwanese to win a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) honorary award, the school said Sunday.The OIE confers the award annually for outstanding contributions to the control of animal disease and/or veterinary public health, and Luo Chu-fang (羅竹芳), a former chair professor at NCKU, was one of the winners in 2020.She was honored for her research into shrimp diseases that has led to her lab earning renown for studying new shrimp diseases and the development of diagnostic tools to detect viral diseases in shrimp, the school said in a statement.Luo was previously affiliated with National Taiwan University (NTU) before transferring to NCKU in 2013 and had taught there until she retired last month.Despite her retirement, Luo's enthusiasm for research remains unabated, and she is now busy establishing the country's first standardized shrimp breeding area in Hualien, the statement said.Luo had no experience in studying crustaceans until 1994, when she witnessed the major impact of the white spot syndrome virus in shrimp on the aquaculture industry and decided to dive into the field.Her research at the time on the pathogenic mechanisms of white spot disease (WSD), an infection from the white spot syndrome virus, was very important, according to a shrimp industry player.Scientists originally thought WSD was caused by a baculovirus, but Luo used DNA sequencing and viral pathogen assembly mechanisms to determine it was caused by a new virus.Because of her research, the lab she led was designated as a reference lab by the OIE, according to Luo.The retired professor said she did most of her basic research and published several papers on shrimp breeding while teaching at NTU, and then after transferring to NCKU used the results to help aquaculture farmers develop their businesses.During her time at NCKU, Luo studied the breeding of specific pathogen free (SPF) shrimp and cultured shrimp resistant to viral diseases, set up an R&D center for shrimp aquaculture and built a high-tech shrimp farm to promote a new form of shrimp farming management.In 2013, Luo collaborated with researchers in Thailand to develop diagnostic kits for the detection of viral diseases in shrimp that have been of tremendous benefit to the marine biotechnology industry and shrimp aquaculture, according to NCKU.(By Yang Sz-ruei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003220010

03/22/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan reported 16 new infections of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, on Sunday (March 22), for a total of 169.

Of the 16 patients to have contracted the viral disease, 13 are imported cases and the other three are local infections. Most of the patients, ranging from 10 to 70 years old, have recently been to Europe, the U.S., the Middle East, and Pacific nations that have reported coronavirus cases.

One of the three locally infected patients, case No. 156, is a caregiver in her 20s serving at two care institutions in the same building. A total of 81 people, including 53 residents and 28 employees from the institutions, tested negative after the caregiver’s infection was confirmed on Saturday (March 21).

The information was passed on by Deputy Health Minister Hsueh Jui-yuan (薛瑞元) at a press conference on Sunday afternoon. He added 14 people who also have had contact with the caregiver are waiting for their test results.

The residents have been moved on to other institutions where they will be cared for separately for two weeks. The 28 employees have been asked to carry out 14-day self-isolation, said Hsueh, adding the institutions would be disinfected.

The caregiver had a fever on March 12 and she went to a doctor three days later. She returned to the hospital on Friday (March 20) and was later tested for the virus, Hsueh said. The origin of infection is not yet known, he added.

The other two locally transmitted cases are both doctorate researchers working with case No. 124, a Taiwanese man in his 30s. Case No. 168 is a German in his 30s, while an Austrian (Case. 169) in her 30s also tested positive for the coronavirus.

It turned out that all three had been infected by their advisor, a Taiwanese in his 50s who has earlier traveled to the U.S., said the Central Epidemic Command Center. The advisor, identified as case No. 160, was the first to have shown symptoms but No. 124 was the first among the four to have been diagnosed, the command center added.

The rest of the latest confirmed cases are Taiwanese who recently arrived from overseas, including a 10-year-old boy returning to Taiwan from the U.K. He was stopped at the airport as he had a fever, fatigue, and coughing.

Among the new cases, five went to a doctor and were given tests, while 10 reported to the authorities after showing symptoms during home quarantine.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3902179
03/24/2020,"Taipei, March 24 (CNA) Amid doubts over the relatively low number of COVID-19 tests being done by Taiwan, Vice President Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) has defended Taiwan's practices, saying large volumes of tests are only needed when sources of infection cannot be traced.As of March 18, Taiwan had conducted 20,014 tests for the new coronavirus disease, compared to 307,024 by South Korea, raising questions over whether Taiwan's testing has been aggressive enough.Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the Central Epidemic Command (CECC), on Saturday turned down a call for conducting more COVID-19 tests as many people have requested getting tested at their own expense.Chen contended that such a practice could increase the number of ""false negative"" cases.In a Facebook post Monday, the vice president, an epidemiologist by profession, said the prevalence of the new coronavirus disease is under 1 per 100,000 people in Taiwan, and ""only a few cases have unknown sources,"" to explain why Taiwan has not conducted more COVID-19 tests.Instead, he said, Taiwan has concentrated its testing of those who have come in contact with infected patients and those categorized as highly vulnerable to COVID-19.""Such a practice guarantees that the tests are proper and efficient and in line with cost/benefit principles,"" the vice president said.To defend Taiwan's process, Chen Chien-jen showed data for 13 countries that have conducted more than 15,000 tests to date on how many tests they have done, the number of positive cases found and the prevalence of the disease in those populations.According to Chen Chien-jen, the figures generally showed that ""the lower the rate of positive tests, the broader the coverage of tests of potentially infected people.""Of the 13 countries, Taiwan had five positive results out of every 1,000 tests conducted, trailing only 0.8 positive tests per 1,000 in the United Arab Emirates and 1.2 positive tests per 1,000 in Russia.In terms of the number of people per 100,000 population found to be infected by COVID-19, Taiwan had the second lowest ratio at 0.45 infections per 100,000 people, behind Russia's 0.14 infections per 100,000 people among the 13 countries, the vice president said.Chen Chien-jen acknowledged, however, that the correlation between positive test rates and infection rates per 100,000 people was not absolute, pointing to statistics from France, Belgium and South Korea.In all three of those countries, roughly 16 people per 100,000 population were infected with COVID-19, but their positive test rates varied greatly.While 27.9 out of every 1,000 tests came back positive in South Korea, the figure was 80.9 positive tests per 1,000 in Belgium and 167.4 positive tests per 1,000 in France.The figures suggest that more tests in South Korea and Belgium were done on people who were not infected while in France more tests were done on people who were infected, the vice president said.In defending his position on Saturday, Chen Shih-chung said more testing ""might not only not help efforts to stem the outbreak, it could even create a quarantine loophole.""He argued that those with ""false negative"" tests could move about without taking precautions, thinking they were free of the virus, while infecting others.According to the CECC, COVID-19 tests are currently performed on ""high-risk"" subjects, divided into two groups. One consists of those who have come in contact with people from foreign countries who had respiratory symptoms and a fever.The other consists of people with pneumonia or who have a fever and respiratory symptoms after returning from countries on the highest risk travel warning list.(By Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003240013
03/24/2020,"Taipei, March 24 (CNA) Yang Chin-long (楊金龍), governor of Taiwan's central bank said Monday that Taiwan has no problems with U.S. dollar liquidity, at a time when central banks around the world are seeking greenback funding through foreign exchange swap deals with the U.S. Federal Reserve.Questioned by Chiu Hsien-chih (邱顯智), a lawmaker from the opposition New Power Party (NPP), Yang said the central bank has signed forex swap deals with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and several other financial institutions so the supply of U.S. dollars in Taiwan is not a problem.Yang made the remarks when he met with the NPP legislative caucus earlier in the day, discussing U.S. dollar liquidity in Taiwan as demand for the U.S. currency has risen, with many investors moving their funds into greenback-denominated assets as a safe haven amid escalating concerns over the spread of COVID-19.After Yang met Chiu, and two other NPP lawmakers -- Wang Wan-yu (王婉諭) and Chen Jiau-hua (陳椒華) -- in a closed door meeting, Chiu told reporters what the central bank governor said when asked whether it would be necessary for the local central bank to sign a U.S. dollar swap deal with the Fed to boost greenback funding and avoid a credit crunch in Taiwan.On March 19, the Fed signed a foreign exchange swap deal with its counterparts in nine countries including Australia, Brazil and South Korea to combat a shortage of U.S. dollars caused by an escalation in COVID-19 contagion.The deals with the nine countries followed similar agreements signed between the Fed and its counterparts in five countries including Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan on March 15.According to the Fed, the swap deals, wherein the U.S. central bank accepts other currencies in exchange for dollars, aim to reduce the strain in global U.S. dollar funding markets and ameliorate the effects of these strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both at home and abroad.According to Chiu, Yang said although the central bank has not signed a forex swap agreement with the Fed, similar deals with the BIS and other financial institutions have allowed the central bank to pledge U.S. treasuries it owns as collateral to secure short term U.S. dollar loans if Taiwan faces a greenback shortage.At present, Yang said he did not see any urgent need for Taiwan to sign a forex swap deal with the Fed.Meanwhile, making supplementary comments on Yang's meeting with the NPP legislative caucus, an official from the central bank told CNA that Taiwan's economy remains sound compared with other countries, and Taiwan's greenback funding has been long term sufficient.More important, the official said Taiwan has large forex reserves and the central bank is committed to maintaining ample reserves by improving investment returns to guarantee secure financial markets at home, even if foreign institutional investors move funds out of the country.At the end of February, Taiwan's forex reserves hit a new high of US$479.68 billion, up US$549 million from a month earlier.At a quarterly policymaking meeting held last week, the central bank, after taking into account the impact of COVID-19, cut its growth forecast for Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 from 2.57 percent, made in December, to 1.92 percent.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wang Yang-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003240009

Within days, surgical face masks disappeared from store shelves, amid panic buying over the country's perceived vulnerability to an outbreak.In response to the shortages, the government banned face mask exports on Jan. 24 and took control of mask distribution from the private sector on Jan. 31.On Feb. 6, it launched a rationing system through the National Health Insurance Administration, limiting people to two masks per week.To increase production, the government invested NT$200 million (US$6.66 million) to purchase new supply lines, and began recruiting a team of about 100 technicians to assemble them at requisitioned manufacturing facilities.In the first phase of the team's deployment, from Feb. 5-March 5, it completed an estimated four-to-six-month workload, assembling 60 supply lines. With each machine able to manufacture 100,000 masks per day, the country's daily mask production jumped from 4 million to 10 million.Reflecting that increase, on March 5 the government raised the mask ration to three adult-sized or five child-sized masks per week.Aside from the technicians themselves, the mobilization's success owed no small debt to the sacrifices made by the 26 requisitioned manufacturers.Huang Che-chun (黃哲諄), chief executive of Sumeasy Enterprises in Keelung City, told CNA he was busy planning his Feb. 22 wedding when he learned that his factory had been requisitioned on Jan. 31.According to Huang, his wife was initially against postponing their plans, arguing that they had already taken their wedding photos and sent out invitations.What convinced her, Huang said, was an honest assessment of the risks. He explained: ""Most of our guests would have come from the industry. If one person was infected, we'd all end up in quarantine and the country's mask production would drop by a third!""""We couldn't take that kind of risk,"" he said.Still, Huang admitted the recent weeks have been challenging. Instead of going on his honeymoon, he has been working 12-hour days, and has had to cancel NT$4 million (US$132,311) in export contracts.Despite the personal costs, his company has expanded from four to nine production lines, while its daily capacity has grown from 400,000 to 1 million masks.From a citizen's perspective, Huang said he sympathized with the government's intervention, without which, he conceded, ""it would be very difficult to guarantee Taiwan's face mask supply.""The team began the second phase of its work on March 6, assembling an additional 32 supply lines, which will boost Taiwan's daily production capacity to a planned 13 million masks by early April.On March 20, it had already completed 28 of the machines, and held a handover ceremony for 15 of them at Chang Hong Machinery, in New Taipei's Wugu District.At the ceremony, Hsu Wen-hsien (許文憲), chairman of the Taiwan Machine Tool and Accessory Builders' Association and one of the project's main organizers, marveled at the industry's response in a time of crisis.When this started in early February, there was so much to consider that ""I felt like I was walking in quicksand,"" Hsu said, adding that to have come so far in a month and a half felt ""unbelievable.""Seeing the scale of the harm caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Hsu said he hoped that after stabilizing Taiwan's mask supply, the team will have the chance to help other countries to deal with their own shortages.In the meantime, he said, the ""national team"" and the manufacturing industry as a whole remain ready to help, for as long as the pandemic continues.Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003240015
03/24/2020,"Taipei, March 24 (CNA) Apple Inc. said Tuesday that it has scrapped an online curb of purchases of iPhones, with market analysts attributing the move to an increase in production of its suppliers, many of which saw an interruption in their output in their production lines in China amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.On its Taiwan website, Apple said it has no longer curbed online purchases of select iPhones and other items after its restrictions were imposed last week.International news media also reported the online purchase limits have been removed from markets such as the United States, China and Hong Kong.According to the curb imposed last week, consumers were limited to online purchases of no more than two of any of its latest iPhone models -- the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max -- that were launched last September.Customers could also buy no more than two of any of its earlier iPhone models -- the iPhone XR, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus -- per online purchase.However, on Apple's China website, consumers there are still allowed to buy up to two iPads and up to five MacBook Airs online, while no limits are set for online purchases for other iPhones.Analysts said the previous quotas had been triggered by a fall in shipments from Apple's suppliers, with production facilities on lockdown in a number of cities to contain the pandemic, disrupting production.The last time Apple put limits on purchases was in 2007, when the iPhone was introduced for the first time, to prevent people from reselling them.Due to the removal of the online purchase limits, many Taiwanese suppliers saw their share prices bouncing back Tuesday from the doldrums a session earlier, analysts said.Among them, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker, rose 2.81 percent to close at NT$69.40 and Pegatron Corp., a smaller iPhone assembler, also added 7.68 percent to end at NT$51.90 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.Meanwhile, Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses, rose 6.23 percent to close at NT$3,665.00 and rival Genius Electronic Optical Co. gained 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$371.00.(By Jeffrey Wu, Han Ting-ting and Frances Huang) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003240010

(TSMC), which vaulted the Taiex past the 9,700-point mark before some profit-taking emerged to cap the gains, the dealers said.""Since an intraday low of 8,523 points Wednesday, the Taiex bounced back significantly, so it came as no surprise that the Taiex came off its high today as some investors just wanted to keep cash on hand for the moment,"" Ta Chan Securities analyst Jerry Chen said.Chen attributed Wednesday's gains to the expectations of the passage of the U.S. stimulus package, with lawmakers in Washington coming closer to cutting a deal about the stimulus measures.""The package, along with the U.S. Federal Reserve's unlimited quantitative easing, is expected to prevent enterprises from closure and keep workers on the payrolls,"" Chen said. ""That is expected to boost consumption, a positive step to keep the U.S. economy rolling.""""Therefore, the Dow soared and markets in the regions, including Taiwan, followed suit,"" he said.

03/25/2020,"Taipei, March 25 (CNA) Researchers in Taiwan have identified an antioxidant compound in locally grown black tea leaves, as a potential inhibitor of protease activity in SARS‐CoV‐2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital said Wednesday.A Taiwanese research team led by Wu Ching-yuan (吳清源), head of the hospital's Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, used a high-performance computing system to identify potential antiviral components and herbals in traditional plants, the university said in a statement that day.After undertaking research, the team found that theaflavin, a polyphenolic compound in black tea, shows broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against several viruses and could be used as a lead compound for the development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV-2) inhibitor that targets an enzyme known as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).In coronaviruses, RdRp is an important protease that catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target, according to Wu.SARS-CoV-2 virus RdRp is also a primary target for the antiviral drug, remdesivir. which has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the most promising drug currently available for the treatment of COVID-19, Wu noted.Remdesivir works by inhibiting RdRp, which many RNA viruses -- including coronaviruses -- use to replicate themselves.The antiviral effects of theaflavin are similar to those of remdesivir, Wu said.However, the exact in vivo effect is still unclear, and further research is needed to confirm the mechanism whereby theaflavin targets SARS‐CoV‐2, Wu stressed.The findings were published by the American Society for Microbiology March 13 in the Journal of Medical Virology, according to the Chiayi hospital.(By Tsai Chi-ming and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003250015

The others are still in negative pressure quarantine rooms in hospital but are all in relatively stable condition, the CECC said.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 455,753 patients in 176 countries and regions, including 81,285 in China, 74,386 in Italy and 65,174 in the U.S, with 20,740 fatalities to date, according to the CECC.(By Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003260009
03/26/2020,"Taipei, March 26 (CNA) Taiwan's constitutional court will hear arguments March 31 on whether an article in the Criminal Code that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after receiving requests from 14 judges and a defendant in an adultery case to do so.Article 239 of the Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, with the other party to the adultery subject to the same punishment, though there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.According to one of the judges who applied for a constitutional interpretation, the article could be at odds with the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and infringes on people's rights, including an individual's right to privacy and bodily autonomy.Women's groups in Taiwan have also voiced their support for the decriminalization of adultery, as they believe the article fails in its stated purpose of keeping marriages intact.""During the court proceedings, people's intimate acts need to be laid bare in court, which destroys the last piece of emotion and trust between a couple,"" said Chuang Chiao-ju (莊喬汝), chairperson of the women's rights group Awakening Foundation, at a Thursday press conference.This leads to a breakdown in communication, which could have led to the couple deciding to work on their marriage or an uncontested divorce, Chuang said.The article has also disproportionately punished women, said lawyer Lin Shih-fang (林實芳), another member of the Awakening Foundation.Men and women are sued for adultery on a ratio of 111 to 100, Lin said, but the ratio of men to women who end up convicted is 81.3 to 100.This indicates that women are likely pressured by their husbands to drop charges against them during the proceedings, yet the charges against the mistresses go ahead, Lin said.In most legal cases, if a plaintiff wishes to drop charges against one party in a lawsuit, the charges for the remaining parties are also dropped, though that is not true for adultery cases.In this situation, the complainant can choose to drop charges on their spouse but still sue the other party, though they cannot decide to drop charges on the other party and only sue their spouse.This particular rule has another inadvertent consequence, said Humanistic Education Foundation Director Feng Chiao-lan (馮喬蘭), which is that it is often used to threaten victims of rape.Feng gave the example of a case in which a teacher allegedly raped a student, but the student didn't press charges due to the fear of being sued for adultery.In these instances, the adultery article becomes a protective shield for rapists, Feng said.Feng was likely referring to the high profile case of Lin Yi-han (林奕含), a budding writer who committed suicide a few months after the publication of her first novel, which was about a 13-year old girl who was raped by her teacher.After her death, her parents released a statement saying that the story was actually Lin's own experience, and alleging that she was raped by a cram school teacher when she was in high school.The reason why the family chose not to press charges was due to the fear of Lin being countersued for adultery, they said.According to two polls conducted by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in 2013, around 80 percent of Taiwanese are opposed to decriminalizing adultery, while a poll conducted in 2017 by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation found that 69 percent of Taiwanese are opposed.(By Lin Chang-shun and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003260014

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei City Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) and New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) agreed Thursday (March 26) to install face mask vending machines in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Under the program, citizens will use their IDs to receive masks from a machine at their local borough office or at schools, the Liberty Times reported. The two cities reached 10 agreements during Thursday’s meeting, most of them related to the virus epidemic.

Joint quarantine centers, similar measures to deal with Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) passengers with fevers, and hotel checks were issues the two mayors agreed on, according to the report. The cities would also share hotel rooms to isolate potential virus cases or people required to stay in quarantine, the mayors said.

In addition to several MRT stations, three stations on the Tamsui Light Rail Transit line would also be fitted with infrared screening equipment. This would lead to passengers with a fever of 38 degrees or higher to be prevented from entering, according to officials.

Speaking to the media the previous day, Hou said that in the case of a virus emergency, the city authorities needed to gain control over the traffic flow within two hours.

03/26/2020,"Taipei, March 26 (CNA) Taiwan government officials said Thursday that a British woman who is in quarantine in Taiwan due to COVID-19 coronavirus control measures has not been ""incarcerated,"" as has been reported by the BBC.At a press conference, Hualien County Health Bureau Director Chu Chia-hsiang (朱家祥) said the woman Natalie Dawson, along with her Australian partner Rohan Pixley, are in quarantine at a facility in Hualien, which was once a school dormitory.They each have a single room of about 26 square meters, which is equipped with internet, a reading desk, chair, bed, and other basic necessities, and they have access to the bathrooms that are on each floor of the building, Chu said.Dawson and Pixley have also been receiving three meals a day during their quarantine, which started shortly after they arrived in Taiwan on March 14, according to Chu.He said when the couple was asked to self-quarantine, the hotel at which they were staying agreed that they could remain there, but they could not afford the cost for an extended period, so they were taken to the former school dorm, at which they pay only NT$250 (US$8.18) each per day for three meals.Chu said he was surprised to see the BBC report, which quoted Dawson's mother as saying that her daughter and Pixley had been separated and ""incarcerated.""""They are locked in and they can't get out,"" the mother Jill Weaver was quoted as saying. ""One man brings them food three times a day. But it is of poor quality and meagre portions.""Weaver also said she was not disputing the need for the quarantine, but rather was taking issue with the conditions in which her daughter was living at the moment.""The room is filthy,"" Weaver was quoted as saying in the BBC report. ""She has no hot water and nowhere to wash her clothes.""In response, Chu said his office had not received any complaints of anyone being locked in at the quarantine facility, but the local government had dispatched police to the site to investigate the claims. He did not say what the police had found.Meanwhile, the British Office in Taipei told CNA Thursday that it has been providing assistance to Dawson, who has special dietary needs.""The staff of the British Office has been working with the Taiwanese authorities to effectively address a number of concerns, including access to food that would meet her essential dietary requirements,"" the office told CNA. ""The Taiwanese authorities have provided her a telephone to maintain contact with family and friends.""The office said its staff has also been providing support to arrange Dawson's onward travel plans when her quarantine ends.According the BBC report, Dawson and Pixley had planned a few days stopover in Taiwan en route to Australia but were told that they had to go into quarantine for 14 days.Also commenting on the issue, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said when Dawson was first taken to the quarantine facility in Hualien, she was given a room with an ensuite bathroom, but she was moved to a different room after she complained that the water heater in the bathroom was not functioning.According to MOFA spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安), Dawson at first was not receiving gluten-free meals, as she had requested, but that was soon addressed.Dawson had also requested that she and Pixley be allowed to stay in the same room, but that was not permitted because it would have defeated the purpose of the quarantine, Ou said.Under Taiwan's current temporary regulations, its borders have been closed to most foreign nationals, and those who entered shortly before the ban was imposed were required to self-quarantine for two weeks, as the country tightened its measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.According to Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), foreign nationals in quarantine in Taiwan may contact the relevant government departments if they need assistance.(By Chen Wei-ting, Chang Chi, Tzeng Yi-shiuan and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003260016

It is aimed at cementing U.S. support for Taiwan's diplomatic alliances around the world, amid pressure from China.The Act authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider ""reducing its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious or significant actions to undermine Taiwan.""It also calls on the U.S. government to help Taiwan gain participation in international organizations, either as a member or an observer, and to express support for Taiwan's international participation whenever Washington has discussions with Beijing.It means that U.S. administrative departments will be encouraged to adopt a so-called diplomatic ""reward/punishment"" program as a countermeasure to China's poaching of Taiwan's diplomatic allies.On the question of whether countries will now be more likely to ""upgrade"" their relations with Taiwan, Curtis said that is the goal.""This is the whole purpose of the bill -- to get people to recognize the importance of Taiwan not just in our relationship but in an international economy,"" he said. ""And we are very hopeful that will have an impact.""Since May 2016 when President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office, Taiwan has lost eight diplomatic allies to China, namely Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, the Solomon Islands, and Kiribati.Currently Taiwan has 15 diplomatic allies, mostly in the Latin American and Caribbean regions.With the TAIPEI Act signed into law, Taiwan is seen as likely to gain U.S. support for its bid to attend a meeting in May of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, particularly in light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.Curtis said the U.S. can learn from Taiwan's prevention and containment response and will work with Taiwan to contain the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19.""We've got to be looking all over the world and seeing what countries that are handling this well, what they're doing, what the procedures are, and how those can be implemented, not just here in the United States, but all over the world,"" he told CNA.Curtis, 59, who speaks fluent Mandarin, has been the representative of the 3rd congressional district of Utah since 2017.

Comprising 16 articles, the regulation encompasses occupational safety, food safety, transportation safety, traffic safety, and consumer rights issues. Food delivery workers must have accident insurance and be allowed to cease delivery services when the government announces the suspension of work should a natural disaster, such as a typhoon, occur.

Employers must notify the authorities in the event of an occupational hazard, implement food safety measures, provide new workers with training, explicitly disclose the price of food items, and put in place refund mechanisms, according to the ordinance.

The Department of Labor said businesses will be held accountable if they continue operations when a typhoon strikes. If delivery personnel lose their lives under such circumstances, employers will be fined between NT$20,000 (US$662) and NT$100,000.

The exposure to Washington on an ultimate risk basis was also the highest among Taiwan's debtor nations.China came in second, as outstanding international claims by Taiwanese banks rose to US$47.44 billion at the end of December on a direct risk basis, up from US$43.84 billion a quarter earlier, the central bank's data showed.Taiwan banks' exposure to China on an ultimate risk basis also rose to US$68.07 billion at the end of December from US$65.09 billion at the end of September, the data indicated.The central bank said the higher exposure to China came from an appreciating Chinese yuan and an increase in investment in China during the three-month period.As of the end of December, outstanding international claims by Taiwanese banks hit US$454 billion at the end of December, up 4.56 percent from the end of September, the data showed.After the U.S. and China, Luxembourg came in third, with Taiwanese banks' exposure on a direct risk basis hitting US$41.46 billion at the end of December, up from US$39.43 billion as of September, ahead of Hong Kong (US$35.78 billion) and Japan (US$33.13 billion).Australia took the No. 6 title, with Taiwanese banks' exposure at US$23.98 billion, followed by the United Kingdom (US$17.84 billion), the Cayman Islands (US$17.57 billion), Singapore (US$16.12 billion), and the British West Indies (US$12.52 billion).Bank exposure to Taiwan's top 10 debtors at the end of December stood at US$335.6 billion, accounting for 73.93 percent of the country's total international claims on a direct risk basis, the central bank said.The non-banking private sector worldwide accounted for 61.07 percent of Taiwan's total international claims on a direct risk basis, with the banking industry making up 30.16 percent and the public sector representing 8.76 percent, the central bank said.(By Su Ssu-yun and Frances Huang) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003280009

03/28/2020,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) A Taiwanese father and son who endured a two-month ordeal in quarantine on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, being treated for the COVID-19 coronavirus in Japan, followed by self-isolation at home in Kaohsiung, have a simple message for the 50,000 Taiwanese currently under home quarantine: Stay at home -- your cooperation could save lives.In an interview with CNA -- the first in which Taiwanese COVID-19 survivors have agreed to disclose their identities -- 85-year-old Mai Wen-ta (麥文達) and 49-year-old Mai Chia-shuo (麥家碩) recounted their experience with the disease and explained why they think such public health measures are necessary.The pair's ordeal began on Jan. 20 when they set sail from Yokohama, Japan on the Diamond Princess.The ship, carrying 3,711 passengers and crew, including 24 Taiwanese, made stops in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa. On Feb. 4, however, it was quarantined in Yokohama Harbor, after it emerged that a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong later tested positive for the virus.As the Japanese authorities began testing the passengers, the Mais were told to remain in their small, windowless cabin. After only three days in the room, Mai Chia-shuo said, he began feeling an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia, which he described as ""like being stuck inside a coffin.""To cope with the isolation, they watched a livestream of the view outside the ship on their television, while friends on board whose cabins had a balcony sent them daily photos of the sun.Within days, however, Mai Wen-ta began suffering nosebleeds and coughing up blood. They reported these symptoms to health authorities aboard the ship, but were told he would have to remain in quarantine unless he had a fever.At that point, said Mai Wen-shuo, ""My main concern was getting my father off the ship"" to get medical treatment.On Feb. 10, he wrote an open letter to Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) in which he described his father's deteriorating health and pleaded for help.The letter was widely covered in the Taiwanese media and drew a quick response from the government, which arranged for doctors to treat Mai Wen-ta and test him for the virus.Both father and son were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 -- on Feb. 13 and 17, respectively -- and were treated at Japanese hospitals over the next several weeks.After they were cleared of the virus, the pair returned to Taiwan on March 10, where they underwent another 14 days of self-health management in Kaohsiung to ensure that they posed no risk to the community.Having come through the experience, Mai Chia-shuo told CNA of his frustration at seeing news reports about people ignoring their home quarantine orders.Such precautions are worth the sacrifice, Mai Chia-shuo stressed, which is why he stayed home, despite testing negative, and missed out on long-awaited reunions with family and friends.In the two months since the Mais boarded the Diamond Princess, the COVID-19 outbreak has burgeoned into a global pandemic, with over 600,000 cases and 27,000 deaths reported as of Saturday.In Taiwan, meanwhile, the number of cases has surged in recent weeks, as an influx of students and travelers have returned from the pandemic's new hotspots, including Europe and the United States.To the 50,000 Taiwanese who, according to Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) statistics, are currently under home quarantine, Mai Chia-shuo could only implore: ""Stay at home to protect yourself and protect others -- that's the best thing you can do.""More personally, Mai Chia-shuo said, the last two months have taught him to value the time he is able to spend with his family, after previously living overseas for more than two decades.""I used to put everything off until tomorrow,"" he said, but after this ""I want to hurry up and do what I should, and not leave behind any regrets.""(By Chang Ming-hsuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003280014
03/28/2020,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) An escalation of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic around the world continued to deal a blow to consumer confidence in Taiwan, in particular when equity investors were shocked by global volatility, according to National Central University (NCU).Citing a survey conducted during March 19-23, when stock markets at home and abroad encountered headwinds amid escalating fears over the COVID-19 spread, NCU said the consumer confidence index (CCI) for March fell 5.42 points from a month earlier to 78.51, the lowest level since July 2017, when the index stood at 78.19.The CCI reflects public confidence in the coming six months in six different areas -- employment, family finances, consumer prices, the local economic climate, the stock market and the likelihood of purchasing durable goods.In March, the sub-index on the equity market fell 11.8 points from a month earlier to 53.70, the lowest level since January 2013, when the figure stood at 52.70, the survey found. The fall was the steepest among the six CCI factors.Dachrahn Wu (吳大任), director of NCU's Research Center for Taiwan Economic Development, said the COVID-19 pandemic escalated in the United States and Europe in March, sending the global financial markets into a tailspin, which in turn hit the local equity market.The benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, or Taiex, fell below the 10,000-point mark on March 16, and moved below 9,000 later in the month before staging a rebound in line with the U.S. markets in the wake of a move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to launch unlimited quantitative easing and hopes of a massive stimulus package.On Friday, the Taiex closed down 0.38 percent at 9,698.92 points after giving up its earlier gains amid lingering fears over the economic impact resulting from the virus spread.Despite a rebound on Wall Street in recent sessions, Wu said, the jobless claims in the U.S. market last week soared to a record high of 3.28 million, and if the U.S. job market continues to weaken, the country's consumption power will be eroded, which in turn will hurt the global economy.Wu said the Fed has sensed the severity of the economic weakness and so launched the unlimited quantitative easing by buying bonds and mortgage-based securities to lend support to the financial markets in the short term, but it remained to be seen how the real economy will be affected in the longer term.Meanwhile, the sub-index on the timing of purchases of durable goods such as homes and cars stood at 104.45, down 6.6 points from a month earlier, the second-steepest drop among the six factors of the CCI, ahead of a decline of 4.5 points in the sub-index on consumer prices of 46.75, the survey showed.Wu said the coronavirus spread is expected to have an adverse impact on the local property market in the short term but with more and more Taiwanese companies with overseas operations returning home to invest, demand in the property market could improve.The sub-index on family finances came in fourth, registering a decline of 4.3 from a month earlier to 91.95 in March, while the sub-indexes on the local economic climate and employment also dropped 3.9 and 1.4, respectively, to 88.95 and 85.25, the survey indicated.According to the NCU, a sub-index score of 0-100 indicates pessimism, while a score of 100-200 shows optimism.In other words, the sub-index on possible purchases of durable goods indicates optimism for the coming six months, the university said.The survey collected 2,795 valid questionnaires from local consumers aged 20 and over. It had a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points.(By Pan Tzu-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003280008

However, since 2007, the average number of applications for hiring migrant workers in the sector was below 10,000, with only 4,100 and 4,400 recorded in 2018 and 2019.According to the MOL, between 2001 and 2011, many major public construction projects were launched, leading to the introduction of a large number of migrant workers.In the past few years, although an increasing number of public projects have been launched, they have been small-scale, causing a decline in the applications for hiring migrant workers, the MOL added.(By Pan Yi-ching and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003290008
03/29/2020,"Taipei, March 29 (CNA) An expert specialized in helping victims of sexual abuse called on the public Sunday to take the issue of male rape seriously after a Taiwanese comedian and a Taipei city councilor both recently shared their experiences of being rape victims when they were young.Wang Yue-hao (王玥好), executive director of Taiwan's Garden of Hope Foundation, told CNA that due to local gender stereotyping, people tend to see men as strong and therefore not subject to rape or sexual violence.Rape and sexual assault are not issues that only affect women, Wang said.Wang, who has three decades of counseling experience, said she has offered counseling to male victims of sexual attack, and even though they may be taller and stronger on the outside, they are still vulnerable to verbal or physical intimidation and threats.She cited government numbers showing that the proportion of men who have reported sexual assault has increased significantly over the past decade.According to Ministry of Health and Welfare numbers, only about 3 percent to 5 percent of reported sexual assault victims were male 10 years ago. The percentage of reported cases had increased to around 10 percent in 2019, Wang noted.The rising number of reports from men could also mean that more male sexual abuse victims are willing to seek help, she added.To meet the increasing demand, Wang said her foundation has set up a hotline for men seeking counseling.Wang said it takes tremendous courage for a male sexual abuse victim to seek help or share their pain with their friends or relatives.She therefore called on family members and friends of male victims to trust their stories while expressing a caring attitude toward them and offering help.They should also avoid sharing the intimate stories of such victims to others, which could further traumatize them, she added.Wang made the comments in response to a confession by Taiwanese standup comedian Brian Tseng (曾博恩), who last week disclosed that he was a victim of rape multiple times during his days in elementary and high school.Tseng, however, did not elaborate on whether his assailants were men or women and did not provide more details of the assaults.Tseng also said that as a victim of rape, he believes one can let go of the painful past and move on.Showing support for Tseng, Taipei City Councilor Chiu Wei-chieh (邱威傑), better known as a YouTuber who goes by the name ""Froggy,"" also disclosed Saturday that he too was a victim of rape when he was only 10 years old in elementary school.In a Facebook post, Chiu said the incident took place at a hospital and that his attacker was a man at least 10 years older than him.Chiu said he did not tell anyone about the incident until years later because traditionally, people in Taiwan do not think men can be victims of sexual assault.Sexual assault is an act in which a person coerces another person to engage in a sexual act against their will, and it is a painful experience whether the victim is a man or a woman, he added.(By Chang Hsiung-feng, Huang Li-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003290012

The party's decision to become the first political party in Taiwan to propose constitutional amendments to lower the voting age thus serves as evidence that it is serious about conducting reform and closing the gap with the younger generation, Ko added.

In response to the KMT's call, DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming (柯建銘) said Saturday that his party has been a long-term supporter of both lowering the legal voting age and the age of candidacy.

The party will propose its own versions of the constitutional amendments and form a constitutional reform committee to deal with the matter within the Legislative Yuan, Ko added.

A constitutional amendment committee is an ad hoc body under the Legislative Yuan that requires the participation of at least 33 percent of all 113 lawmakers, with its makeup determined by the proportion of seats each party caucus has on the legislative floor. In Taiwan, a revision to the Referendum Act that took effect in January 2018 lowered the voting age for referendums from 20 to 18.

Lowering the voting age in general elections and the age of candidacy, however, can only be done by amending the Constitution. Such an amendment would be challenging because a motion to amend the Constitution must be sponsored by at least 25 percent of legislators to be valid and approved by at least 75 percent of the members present at a meeting attended by at least 75 percent of the 113 lawmakers.

After the Legislative Yuan passes the resolution to amend the Constitution, it must be referred to a national referendum six months after the government's announcement of the proposed amendment. The referendum needs to be passed by more than half of the total number of eligible voters, which stood at over 19.31 million in 2020, according to Article 12 of the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3906633

03/30/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former Taiwan Premier Hau Pei-tsun ( 郝柏村 ) died at the age of 101 at the Tai-Service General Hospital in Nei Hu District, Taipei on Monday (March 30).

The former top general, born in Jiangsu Province in 1919, enrolled in the R.O.C. Military Academy in 1935. During the early years of World War II, he participated in the Guangzhou Battle (廣州戰役) against the Japanese, and he later fought them again with the Chinese Expeditionary Force from 1942 to 1945, the Liberty Times reported.

In 1949, he came to Taiwan with the retreating Nationalist Party’s (KMT) troops. In 1958, when the August 23 Artillery Battle broke out, Hau was the division commander of the Army responsible for defending Little Kinmen, also called Lieyu. After the battle was over, he was awarded medals for successful defense of the islet.

Hau was promoted to the rank of four-star general by then President Chiang Ching-kuo (蔣經國) and tapped as Chief of the General Staff in 1981, a post he held for eight years, longer than any other top general in that position.

After Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) became president of Taiwan in 1988, Hau was promoted to the position of minister of national defense in 1989 and then premier in 1990. The new premier’s assumption of office drew protests from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which was opposed to ""using a serviceman to interfere with politics.” Hau resigned as premier in 1993.

However, Lee later revealed that his secret intention in tapping Hau as premier was to make him retire from the military and end his power over that institution.

Hau exited the KMT in 1995 and became Lin Yang-kang’s (林洋港) running mate in the country’s first direct presidential election in 1996. They were defeated by Lee, who won reelection. Hau’s KMT membership was voluntarily restored by the party in 2005.

Hau became a Christian and was baptized at the age of 98. He was hospitalized at the Tai-Service General Hospital in April last year, and he died Monday from stroke-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Hau is survived by his son, former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin (郝龍斌).",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3907313
03/30/2020,"Taipei, March 30 (CNA) Taiwan needs to increase testing and implement social distancing regulations to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, public health experts said Monday at a weekly press conference.The number of COVID-19 cases in Taiwan has been relatively low because the government imposed travel restrictions early, but new measures are now necessary to flatten the curve before the infections reach 1,000, said Chan Chang-chuan (詹長權), dean of National Taiwan University's College of Public Health (NTUCPH).Furthermore, the country's quarantine measures will be more effective if they are combined with increased testing, Chan said at the press conference at NTUCPH in Taipei.Also speaking at the press event, NTUCPH Vice Dean Chen Hsiu-hsi (陳秀熙) said Taiwan should expand COVID-19 testing to include everyone arriving from abroad and members of the communities in which infections have been confirmed.""It is only through testing that we can find all the infections lurking in the corners of society,"" Chan said. ""We are not hunting for the infected, but instead we are looking for the virus so we can stop its transmission.""The issue of testing came to the fore last weekend, when Taiwan reported 31 new COVID-19 cases, including a man in his 50s who developed symptoms as far back as Feb. 28 but was not tested during his many visits to the doctor, apparently because he had no recent history of overseas travel.It was not until March 26 when he went to the hospital with severe breathing difficulty and a fever that he was suspected of having COVID-19, and he was confirmed on March 28, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said in a news briefing Sunday.The patient has an underlying chronic respiratory illness, the CECC said.Meanwhile, NTUCPH professor Lin Hsien-ho (林先和) said at Monday's press conference that social distancing regulations are also important in the efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19.Unlike SARS in 2003, COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms in more than half of the patients, and many are asymptomatic in the early stages of the infection, Lin said.He suggested the implementation of social distancing regulations that would limit physical interaction between people and keep them at least two meters apart in public spaces.Citing Singapore's measures, he said markers can be placed on escalators and in queues to guide people on the distance that must be maintained.At a legislative hearing Monday, Deputy Health Minister Hsueh Jui-yuan (薛瑞元) said regulations for social distancing are currently being planned and will be implemented in the three phases -- setting guidelines and building a general consensus, promoting the policy through counseling and education, and imposing fines for non-compliance.On Monday, Taiwan reported eight new COVID-19 infections and another two deaths, bringing its total number of cases to 306 and its fatalities to five, since the coronavirus emerged in China at the end of last year.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003300016

03/30/2020,"Taipei, March 30 (CNA) A high-ranking official at Taiwan's Tourism Bureau was demoted Monday for official misconduct that led to one of his colleagues becoming infected with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).The official was removed from his position and will be transferred to a lower position pending an investigation into the case, the bureau said in a statement.According to the bureau, the official asked a Tourism Bureau staffer working at a Taoyuan International Airport visitor information center to meet and tend to his son, who was returning from the Philippines on March 20, while the son was waiting to be picked up by the official.Both the son, who is in his 20s, and the airport staffer were confirmed to have contracted the virus on March 28, and have been identified by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) as case No. 277 and No. 269, respectively.Since the airport staffer had no recent travel history, it was highly likely that he was infected by the official's son because the two had coffee together at the airport, the CECC said.Even worse, the five-year-old son of the airport staffer was confirmed as having the disease Monday, resulting in the suspension of his kindergarten for 14 days and home isolation for 17 people the five-year-old came in contact with, the CECC said.The bureau found that the airport staffer met the official's son in the control area as soon as the son got off the plane and accompanied him to the arrival lounge, which did not follow the bureau's standard operating procedures, the bureau said.The fact that the two lingered at the airport to wait for the official was inappropriate as that increased the risk of infecting other people, a violation of disease control measures, according to the bureau.It also determined that the official, who has not developed COVID-19 symptoms, drove to the airport to pick up his son during work hours after notifying his supervisor verbally that he was heading out of the office rather than taking formal leave, a violation of Tourism Bureau rules.The relationship between the official and the airport staffer was not immediately clear, with some local media saying the high-ranking official directed the staffer to help as a subordinate and others saying the two were friends.In an interview with Apple Daily, the official described the airport staffer as a colleague he has known for a long time who also knows his son and said he simply asked his colleague as a friend to check on his son.The incident also raised concerns as the official, despite learning that his son developed symptoms on March 22, still attended a meeting with other officials such as Transportation Minister Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) and Deputy Minister Wang Kwo-tsai (王國材).But Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC, said there are no plans to test the official as he has not developed related symptoms and started home isolation after his son tested positive.The Transportation Ministry said it has been checking the official's itinerary over the past week to see if the official could have possibly infected others.(By Wang Shu-fen and Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003300024

Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310025
03/31/2020,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310017

They include TTFB Company Limited, famous in Taiwan for its Thai cuisine; Brasserie, a buffet restaurant at the Regent Hotel; and Hi-Lai Foods Inc.A few others, however, expressed worry that the new social distancing regulations will cripple their business, which is already sluggish due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Tofo Restaurant Group said that while it would do its best to comply with the CECC's guidelines, it feared that its revenue would drop by half in these difficult times.Nonetheless, Tofo Restaurant said, it would not resort to furloughs or salary cuts for its employees but rather would try to boost its online orders and take-out sales.As restaurants and beverage shops are expected to be among the hardest hit businesses in the country due to the coronavirus, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has allocated NT$265 million (US$8.75 million) in bailout funds for that sector, in the ministry's NT$20.491 billion economic relief package.The funds will be used primarily to help restaurants shift to e-commerce and delivery platforms, the MOEA said, adding that eligible restaurants and retailers can apply from April 10 to go digital.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Ming-yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004010021
04/1/2020,"In line with a recent announcement by Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), restaurants across Taiwan are starting to come on board with the concept of ‘social distancing’ albeit slowly.

Requirements to maintain a personal space of 1.5 metres from others when indoors have now seen at least two major domestic restaurant groups adopt new policies.

A number of others, however, have pushed back against the government’s latest effort to help stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Typically referring to potential loss of income should customers be forced to sit apart, those reluctant to follow the guidelines can apply for government help in shifting their services to delivery based operations from Friday, April 10th.

As part of a package aimed at helping those most affected by the pandemic the central government’s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) last month set aside NT $265 million for such purposes.

First issued on Tuesday before being expanded on Wednesday, the CECC guidelines also stated that restaurants or similar facilities should close their doors for a while should they not be able to follow the social distancing concept.

No penalties for non-compliance of the rules have yet been made public as far as can be ascertained.

Social distancing spacing in outdoor areas should be maintained at a distance of one metre according to the CECC.

Similar measures to bring social distancing to the fore are already in place at other places of business across Taiwan.

In a message on his Facebook page, Lai said that these are extraordinary times, so virus prevention should come first. Ancestors will understand the intention of relatives without the latter having to visit their graves, Newstalk reported.

A high number of people returning to Taiwan and meeting relatives for traditional holiday activities may pose a new challenge in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), according to Lai. He called on those coming in from overseas to respect regulations and to stay in quarantine for 14 days, while other members of the public should avoid crowded locations and practice social distancing.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan has teamed up with Czechia in the fight against the coronavirus (COVID-19), which has infected nearly one million people worldwide and killed over 47,000 as of Thursday (April 2).

“To further strengthen consultation and cooperation on combatting the COVID-19 virus, both offices will seek to mediate and share best practices and cooperation,” stated a joint statement released by Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday (April 1). The statement was signed by Taiwan’s representative to the central European nation, Ke Liang-ruey (柯良叡), and the representative of the Czech Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei, Patrick Rumlar.

The Czech Republic is the first European country to reach a cooperative agreement with Taiwan on the epidemic. According to the joint statement, the collaboration will include the developments of test kits, vaccines, and medication in addition to research into health technology and information sharing for both countries’ virus response.

The central European nation has had a close relationship with Taiwan in the field of technology, according to Taiwanese authorities. Last month, James Liao (廖俊智), the president of Academia Sinica, Taiwan’s foremost research institute, held a video conference with his Czech counterpart Eva Zazimalova, from the Czech Academy of Sciences, to discuss possible collaborations on coronavirus-related research.

Also last month, Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek thanked Taiwan for donating 25 ventilators and 100 protective masks to the country. “They will go directly to our hospitals next week,” stated Patricek, who went on to say, “Solidarity is now important. Thanks!”

Commenting on Taiwan’s donations, Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib, a staunch supporter of Taiwan-Czech relations, proclaimed that Taiwan’s humanitarian aid is different from China’s , which he described as “sell[ing] state protective equipment for taxpayers’ money.” Prague has received nine ventilators from Taiwan.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3909178

Based on findings from previous studies on the SARS epidemic, the NHRI — in collaboration with the National Defense Medical Center — discovered that SARS antigens could also be used to test for the coronavirus, reported CNA.

Similar to the method used to test for influenza, only a nasal swab is required to collect a secretion sample. The secretions are then placed in a test kit containing coronavirus antibodies, which will cling to the virus.

A change of color or the appearance of a visible line on the test strip indicates a positive result.

The nasal swab test would be less costly to produce than a nucleic acid test and could be widely used at clinics and hospitals for a quick diagnosis. This would contribute to early intervention and prompt quarantine measures before suspected patients’ symptoms get worse while reducing the risk of additional infections, NHRI Vice President Sytwu Huey-kang (司徒惠康) stated.

More experiments are still needed to ensure the accuracy of the diagnostic test, Sytwu declared. He added that there was no timetable for when it could be ready for clinical use.

The city had initially proposed to launch the measure on April 9, when each Taiwanese resident will be allowed to buy nine masks once every two weeks, as there will be enough face masks to go around, CNA quoted Taipei City Deputy Mayor Huang Shan-shan (黃珊珊) as saying.

However, later in the day, the central government announced it would force all users of public transport to use masks, leading to Taipei City announcing its new measure would start Saturday (April 4).

The central government had already recommended that people keep a “social distance” of 1 meter outdoors and 1.5 m indoors, and when that is not possible, such as in the public transportation systems, then people should wear masks.

At the moment, citizens ae still lining up outside pharmacies to buy masks, which means that the supply is still not enough, but from April 9, everyone should have one mask per day, allowing passengers to wear one during their journey, Huang stated.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3909701
04/3/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A South Korean couple who failed to pay the fine for evading coronavirus quarantine measures were nabbed at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport as they tried to flee the country, reports said Friday (April 3).

As the couple had not stayed inside their hotel in Kaohsiung for 14 days following their arrival, the city's health authorities fined them NT$150,000 (US$4,960) each. However, they disappeared and also failed to pay the fine by the given deadline, CNA reported.

Agents from the Ministry of Justice and the National Immigration Agency intercepted them as they were about to board a flight out of Taoyuan Thursday (April 2).

The couple said they did not have the money to spend the rest of their time in Taiwan at a hotel, leading to the intervention of the South Korean office in Taipei. The two travelers were not expected to be allowed to leave Taiwan before they had paid the fine in full, according to the report.

Foreign citizens have since been barred from entering Taiwan, with the exception of a limited number of categories such as holders of residence permits.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3909884
04/3/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwanese and U.S. government officials held a telephone meeting to discuss ways to increase Taiwan’s international participation amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as the island nation has been consistently praised for successfully controlling the spread of the virus.

“The discussion focused on creating forums to share the successful and internationally lauded Taiwan Model on fighting COVID-19 with countries around the world,” said U.S. State Department’s spokesperson office via a statement on Friday (April 3). The meeting was attended by high-level officials representing the State Department, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), and representative offices of the two nations.

“Participants also discussed ongoing efforts to reinstate Taiwan’s observer status at the World Health Assembly, as well as other avenues for closer coordination between Taiwan and the World Health Organization,” according to the statement. “Countries around the world can benefit from better understanding the Taiwan Model as well as the generous contributions and impressive expertise from Taiwan,” it added.

Taiwan and the U.S. issued a joint statement last month on collaborating to combat the coronavirus, which has infected more than one million people worldwide and killed over 50,000 since it first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The deal involves research regarding test kits, vaccines, and medication for the coronavirus.

Under this project, Taiwan will donate 200,000 surgical masks to the U.S. on a weekly basis, and in return, the U.S. will provide materials that can be made into 300,000 pieces of protective clothing.

During a recent meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the State Department would do its best to assist Taiwan in playing a role in the world’s highest health policy-setting body. He added that the Department of State would comply with the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.

The act stipulates that the U.S. should work to strengthen Taiwan’s relations with its allies and expand Taiwan’s global standing. In addition, the American government should use its vote, voice, and influence to advocate Taiwan’s participation in international organizations as either a member or an observer.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the bilateral governmental meeting. “During the meeting, we shared an array of measures implemented in Taiwan to tackle the coronavirus,” it said in a statement.

Both parties also discussed possible ways to facilitate cooperation between Taiwan and countries sharing similar values and to promote Taiwan’s inclusion in the international community, the ministry added.

Participants in the meeting included U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs Pam Pryor, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Ambassador Atul Keshap, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Jonathan Fritz, Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Kelly Hsieh (謝武樵), and Taiwan’s Representative to the U.S. Stanley Kao (高碩泰).",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3909728
04/3/2020,"Taipei, April 3 (CNA) An article posted on a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has highlighted the early steps Taiwan took to contain the spread of the new coronavirus disease in the country, especially its coordination and use of information.""Of note, the centralized, real-time database of the country's national health insurance (NHI) helped support disease surveillance and case detection,"" said the essay, titled ""Policy Decisions and Use of Information Technology to Fight 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease, Taiwan.""The article, which appears on the U.S. CDC's ""Emerging Infectious Diseases"" journal and will be published in July, argued that the comprehensive response and innovative use of the NHI database by Taiwan's CDC effectively delayed and contained community transmission in Taiwan.That was accomplished even as the number of confirmed cases surged in neighboring countries in Asia starting in mid-February, said the article written by a research team that included members of Taiwan's CDC.The research team wrote that as soon as China reported an unidentified outbreak of 27 cases of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019, Taiwan assembled a task force and began doing quick health checks of passengers inside planes from Wuhan after they landed in Taiwan.Thanks to its rapid implementation of disease prevention measures, Taiwan detected and isolated the country's first coronavirus case on Jan. 20, it said, noting that laboratories in Taiwan developed 4-hour test kits and isolated two strains of the coronavirus before February.The adept use of the database was made possible, the team wrote, by adding people's travel histories to China and all confirmed and suspected case contacts to the NHI database.Those additions and the usual real-time NHI information on patients' health history ""helped pinpoint high-risk patients"" and gave the Taiwan CDC ""the ability to quickly identify new patterns of symptoms or clustered cases and the source or path of infection,"" the team said.Other factors leading to the effective response, the article said, were the experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak, prevalent public awareness, a robust public health network, support from health care industries, and cross-departmental collaborations.Despite its proximity to China, where the COVID-19 outbreak originated, Taiwan has reported a relatively low 348 confirmed cases with five deaths.Globally, the virus has so far infected over 1 million people in 188 countries, and more than 50,000 of them have died of the disease.The research team was led by Duke University professor Pikuei Tu (涂碧桂) and Taiwan CDC chief Chou Chih-hao (周志浩).The deputy director-general of the CDC, Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥), told CNA on Friday that Taiwan faced the infectious disease from China with extreme caution because of its geographic proximity to China and its painful experience in fighting SARS in 2003.""Different from some other countries, in which cities and states fought against the outbreak alone, Taiwan strengthened cross-departmental collaboration on quarantines,"" Chuang said.With the assistance of the police administration system, for example, local governments could quickly locate those who had contact with infected patients to stem the spread of the virus.(By Chang Ming-hsuan and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202004030013

04/3/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The legislator Lin Shu-fen (林淑芬) held a press conference with several environmental nonprofits on April 1, accusing Tainan City government of allowing corn-harvesting even though the farmland is gravely polluted by chromium, a metal which causes respiratory problems and kidney damage in humans.

In February, Tainan Community College disclosed the issue of stainless steel waste in corn farms throughout Houbi,Tainan. Investigators categorized three areas of a farm based on how well the corn grew and found the concentration of chromium was pegged as below 180 parts per million (ppm), 650 ppm and above 2000 ppm.

In some areas, the concentration even hit 3300 ppm, way above the average of 0.2 ppm found in Taiwan's farmlands.

However, the city's environmental bureau revealed in an article on March 23, that test results showed that the toxicity levels in the local soil, groundwater, and corn in the same area were all below the maximum limit. Tainan City Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) promised the land was safe to grow crops.

Hsieh He-lin (謝和霖), Secretary-General from Taiwan Watch Institue, pointed out that erroneous sampling procedures were the main reason for the contradictory test results. In fact, the primary soil had been mixed with the waste when people plowed the field, but the authorities only sampled the bottom layer of soil that was not contaminated, the Taiwan Environmental Information Association (TEIA) reported.

Although the environmental bureau explained that authorities had required the perpetrators to remove the waste and initiated the prosecution under the Agricultural Development Act. These actions, however, are seen as inefficient.

Lin argued that after the amendment of the Waste Disposal Act, stainless steel waste would no longer be categorized as a ""reusable product."" The authorities could simply demand landowners to remove the waste and even issue fines if necessary.

""If the Bureau does not execute the Waste Disposal Act but shifts the responsibility to local prosecutors, it is obvious inaction, a covering for illegal conduct,"" Lin declared.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3909787

04/4/2020,"EU urges government to halt executions

By Lin Chia-nan / Staff reporter





The EU yesterday called on Taiwan to refrain from using the death penalty, following the execution of murderer Weng Jen-hsien (翁仁賢) on Wednesday.

The Supreme Court on July 10 last year sentenced Weng, 53, to death after he was convicted of killing his parents, his niece, his nephew, his nephew’s wife and his parents’ caregiver in 2016.

Weng was executed in New Taipei City on Wednesday evening.

“The European Union condemns this crime in the strongest terms and expresses its sincere sympathy to the family of his victims,” the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan yesterday wrote on Facebook in English, relaying a statement from the EU Foreign Affairs Council.

“At the same time, the EU recalls its opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances. The EU believes that the death penalty is a cruel and inhumane punishment, which fails to act as a deterrent to crime and represents an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity,” it wrote.

“The European Union therefore calls on Taiwan to refrain from any future executions, to reinstate and maintain a de facto moratorium and to pursue a consistent policy towards the abolition of the death penalty in Taiwan,” it added.

Weng’s was the second execution carried out since President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) took office in May 2016, following the execution of death row inmate Lee Hung-chi (李宏基) in 2018.

The Ministry of Justice on Wednesday said in a news release that it understands there are different opinions about the death penalty, adding that it has been cautious about conducting executions before Taiwanese society reaches a consensus to abolish capital punishment.

The ministry said that it would continue communicating with advocates of abolishing or suspending the death penalty and working to strengthen social security and victim support networks, as well as educational initiatives on restorative justice, human rights and the rule of law, so that it might propose alternatives to capital punishment.

The Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty on Thursday said that it would withdraw from a ministry task force established in 2010 to research the gradual abolition of capital punishment, citing the ministry’s inaction on the issue.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/04/05/2003734040

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) thanked Japan and India Saturday (April 4) for helping 25 citizens leave India and Fiji amid the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

A total of 17 Taiwanese who had been stuck in India due to that country’s three-week lockdown had left and arrived in Taiwan on April 1, 3 and 4 with help from Japan, CNA reported. Another eight Taiwanese also succeeded in leaving the Pacific island state of Fiji with assistance from MOFA.

The evacuation from India occurred with help from the Japanese embassy there, which had asked Japanese airlines to allow Taiwanese citizens to take up empty seats. The Taiwanese took the flights to Tokyo and transited there to reach Taiwan, MOFA said.

Due to a recent extension of restrictions for foreign arrivals in Japan, Fiji Airways first canceled its flights to Tokyo, stranding the Taiwanese on the island. However, consultations between the three countries led to a resolution, with the airline organizing a special flight which carried the eight Taiwanese to Japan, according to MOFA.

The ministry said it would continue to pay attention to the needs of Taiwanese citizens overseas wishing to return home during the coronavirus pandemic.

04/5/2020,"Taipei, April 5 (CNA) Father Giuseppe Didone (呂若瑟) expressed gratitude for the donations made by Taiwanese to provide materials vital to quarantine work in Italy, one of the countries worst-hit by the new coronavirus, said the hospital in northeastern Taiwan where the Italian priest has served for over a half century.More than 2,500 donations were made, surpassing NT$10 million (US$333,000) in total, to the fundraising center of Camillian Saint Mary's Hospital Luodong in Yilan County after Didone issued a public letter Wednesday asking for help to save his ""other homeland.""After the appeal many Taiwanese either wired money or made donations in person at the center, some indicating a desire to repay the care of Italian priests who have worked at the hospital over the years,  center head Lee Li-chiu (李麗秋) told CNA Saturday.""Love increases in size like a snowball,"" she said, adding that Father Didone was very grateful for the love expressed by Taiwanese people.On Saturday a senior citizen visited the hospital with his grandson, the latter handing over his piggy bank as a donation, according to staff at the fundraising center.The grandfather added NT$6,000 to his grandson's donation.Also a senor citizen living in Yilan's Jiaoxi Township made a donation on Saturday to repay the medical care he received at the hospital 51 years ago when he was badly injured in an industrial accident, the fundraisers said. In a joint media interview on Thursday, Father Didone lamented that while state-funded hospitals in Italy are mostly adequately supplied, many smaller local clinics are suffering from massive shortages of masks, ventilators, protective gowns and medications amid the COVID-19 pandemic.However, he admitted that the Camillian Order, which operates the hospital, has currently no access to places where it can purchase quarantine supplements for Italy, which has reported over 120,000 cases and a world-leading 15,362 deaths from the disease, as of Sunday.""Watching the outbreak back home, we 'Taiwanese' from Italy could do nothing but keep trying to seek every possible way to help,"" said Father Didone, ""Luckily, we continued to receive donations from Taiwan, which is willing to give unselfishly for those suffering in our Italian home.""Because of current government restrictions on the purchase and export of medical supplies, the Camillian Order said it is seeking permission from Taiwan's government to purchase the supplies locally and ship them to Italy.If that fails, the Order said it would consider trying to purchase the products abroad.The fundraising campaign will end on April 15, no matter how many donations are received by that date, Father Didone said, because in many other corners of the world, people are also waiting for aid.On Saturday, Lee said after the fundraising concludes, the center will discuss with the Camillians in Italy and Taiwan's government how to spend the donations on medical and quarantine materials and transport them to the most-needed COVID-19-stricken areas in Italy as soon as possible.Didone, who first came to Taiwan in 1965, established special care centers for intellectually disabled people in Penghu and Yilan counties. He now works at the Camillian Saint Mary's Hospital in Yilan's Luodong Township.In 2017, Didone and his late brother Antonio were among six members of the Camillian Order to receive Taiwanese citizenship, in recognition of their contributions to Taiwanese society.(By Worthy Shen and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004050008

While on patrol the night of March 31, Officer Guo Jun-hong (郭俊鴻) spotted a woman standing at the door of a convenient store in Yehliu, the report said. Guo felt something was not right and went to question her.

The woman, surnamed Yu (余), told the officer that she came from Singapore and entered Taiwan on March 11.

Yu explained that she had to cut back on expenses to save her remaining money. She told the officer that she planned to stay overnight under a makeshift canvas tent near a parking lot. However, as the weather turned worse, the officer was worried that the foreign tourist might suffer from hypothermia if she slept there.

Therefore, wiith her consent, Guo took Yu back to the station.

After checking her temperature, the officer provided her with hot water, instant noodles, toast, and disposable heat pads to warm up. Then he arranged for her to sleep on a sofa in the station for the night.

04/6/2020,"Taipei, April 6 (CNA) Taiwan-based smartphone vendor HTC Corp. saw revenues rise in March from the previous month after two straight months of declines, but the numbers were still well done from a year earlier.In a statement, HTC said it posted consolidated sales of NT$430 million (US$14.24 million) in March, up 3.1 percent from a month earlier, climbing out of a more than 10 percent fall in February.But the March number was still down 67.07 percent year-on-year.In February, HTC's consolidated sales dipped to NT$419 million, the lowest for the company in almost 20 years, down 12.34 percent from a month earlier and also down 32.96 percent from a year earlier.The rise in sales came after HTC unveiled new VR services for enterprise users for its Vive Pro Eye headset, which was introduced in early 2019, analysts said.The solutions, which enable enterprises to hold virtual meetings, saw rising demand from a business sector eager to avoid the spread of the new coronavirus disease, helping HTC generate higher sales in March, analysts said.In the first three months of this year, HTC's consolidated sales totaled NT$1.33 billion, down 54.83 percent from a year earlier, indicating that the company's core smartphone sales continue to tumble throughout its product range.Its VR operations continue to account for only a small fraction of HTC's total sales and have not been able to help offset the impact resulting from a sharp fall in smartphone shipments, analysts have said.HTC has said, however, that it will continue to invest in VR development by upgrading both its hardware and software offerings for the domestic and overseas markets.HTC announced in March that it was teaming up with eXtra, the largest consumer electronics gadget retailer in Saudi Arabia, to give Xtra Life VR park visitors the chance to experience VR applications.Saudi Arabia's first VR park is expected to attract about 360,000 visitors a year.The two companies are planning to open more Xtra Life VR parks in other countries in the Middle East.(By Jiang Ming-yan and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202004060018

After they gave the go-ahead, though asking for a few alterations, the supplier began producing it in bulk.""We have created around 500 boxes to be distributed to hospitals around Greater Jakarta,"" Christa said, with 100 of them already delivered on April 3.""Making the Aerosol Box is actually very new to our suppliers,"" but ""they are very eager and excited to make the boxes because it is for a good cause,"" she said.A key condition of Lai in sharing the design worldwide on Facebook last month was that it not be used for commercial purposes. In that spirit, the units are being given to the roughly 200 hospitals that have requested them so far for free.The first 250 boxes were funded by Christa's company through BLP Givesback, BLP Beauty's social corporate responsibility program.A crowdfunding campaign was then launched and raised about 100 million rupiah (NT$184,000, or US$6,080) to make the next batch of 250 units.The crowdfunding initiative will continue until April 17 to raise funds for additional demand, which has totaled 900 units to date, according to Christa.Lai's ""Aerosol Box"" is a transparent cube made of acrylic that covers a patient's head during endotracheal intubation, a necessary procedure for patients with COVID-19 who suffer respiratory failure.It has two holes on one side through which physicians can insert their arms to perform the procedure while being shielded from the patient's respiratory droplets and aerosol.The Indonesian version has been altered to accommodate the different doctors working on the front lines, said Christo Ekapatria, a physician at Siloam Hospitals in Tangerang who helped evaluate the box for local use.The circular cutouts of 10 centimeters in diameter were made larger to accommodate bigger doctors, and a third hole was added to one side of the box so that it can be used for intubation during surgeries.""Doctors need a hole to insert a cable or oxygen tube,"" Christo said. ""If the tube enters from the same holes, it will disturb doctors' maneuvers.""Designed as a makeshift response in an emergency when protective gear for medical professionals is lacking, the device has come in handy as more patients need to be intubated as the pandemic spreads and N95 masks are depleted.""When the first wave of COVID-19 came to Indonesia, we weren't ready, just like other countries.

04/7/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After Beijing mocked French scholars and politicians for supporting Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO), the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday (April 7) that the Chinese government should not prioritize politics before human lives.

In an appeal titled ""WHO must fully collaborate with Taiwan,"" which was published in the French news magazine L'Obs, more than 120 French parliamentarians and academics referred to Taiwan's management of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis as ""admirable."" They said the island nation deserved to be recognized for its efforts and admitted into the WHO.

The French signatories stressed that while Taiwan had done an exemplary job of containing the spread of the virus, it is still being excluded from the largest international health body. They added that Taiwan is currently the only country in the world that has centralized information gathering and decision-making within a cross-sector command: the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

The group urged the WHO to acknowledge Taiwan and allow it to join its meetings, asserting that the WHO needs Taiwan just as much as Taiwan needs the WHO.

On Monday (April 6), the Chinese representative office in France responded to the appeal by saying the statement exposed the signatories' lack of international knowledge. The office spokesman said it was laughable to suggest Taiwan should be recognized as a country when in reality, it is only a region of ""mother China,"" reported UDN.

Addressing China's comments during a press briefing Tuesday, MOFA spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) said the international community had started to notice Taiwan because of its successful coronavirus prevention and that China should cast politics aside amid the pandemic. She also expressed gratitude to the French group and promised that Taiwan will continue to share its experiences with the rest of the world, reported Liberty Times.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3911792

They said Chen kept parts of the victim's body as trophies.When the woman's family reported her as missing, police launched a search and listed Chen as the main suspect.

04/7/2020,"Taipei, April 7 (CNA) A Taiwanese research team has produced 25 human monoclonal antibodies based on antibody gene segments from three patients infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus.Huang Kuan-ying (黃冠穎), a resident physician at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital who led the research team, told the press Tuesday that the achievement could facilitate the development of not only rapid screening kits but also medication that targets the virus.Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immune system proteins that are created in the lab. They are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Like the body's own antibodies, mAbs recognize specific targets.The mAbs, made based on antibodies in B cells of the patients, are 13 strains targeting the spike protein (S) of the coronavirus and 12 strains targeting the nucleocapsid protein (N) of the virus.B cells are a type of white blood cell that make antibodies. They are part of the immune system and develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. They are also called B lymphocyte.Since the antibodies can identify the virus, they are useful in two areas, including the development and production of rapid testing agents, Huang said, and if such antibody testing agents react to tissue samples containing the virus, they can show the result in a minimum of 30 minutes.The other area in which they can be used is therapy, Huang went on, because mAbs are regarded as ""magic bullets"" that can cure some infectious diseases.His team found that there is one particular strain among the 13 S-targeting mAbs that has the ability to block the paths that the new coronavirus can use to invade the body, Huang said.He explained that for the virus to enter cells, it has to integrate with the cell receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, which is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells in organs.""The receptor is like a gate. If the virus outflanks an antibody to open it, the body will be infected,"" the researcher said. ""But if the antibody opens the gate first, it has the opportunity to stop the virus from entering cells.""Shih Shin-ru (施信如), a professor at the Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections of Chang Gung University, said this certain mAb, which was found capable of stopping the coronavirus from invading the body, can be used in the development of COVID-19 therapies or even vaccines if it is proven effective in human tests in the future.Compared with animal mAbs, those from humans will be safer to use in medical treatment, she added.(By Chen Wei-ting and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202004070017
04/8/2020,"Taiwan ought to face challenge of making senior citizens self-reliant and healthy (AP/Getty photo) Taiwan ought to face challenge of making senior citizens self-reliant and healthy (AP/Getty photo)

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After more than two months of upheaval, the world has now understood how transmissible and deadly the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is, especially for the elderly, who appear to be the most vulnerable amid this pandemic.

In the past weeks, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many developed countries. Italy, among the most hard hit, has demonstrated how disastrous things can be for an aged country unprepared for the lethal virus: 23 percent of its population are aged 65 or older, while 38 percent of its coronavirus cases are people more than 70 years old.

Although Taiwan's swift actions were able to effectively stem the spread of coronavirus, a similar virus scenario decades later would result in a completely different outcome. By 2065, 41.2 percent of Taiwan's population would be above 65 years old.

A future virus outbreak would result in medical staff overwhelmed by a wave of elderly infections.

Since the increase of elderly people is an inevitable trend, Taiwan ought to have robust seniors who are resilient to diseases and able to continue contributing to the country despite their age.

""Nations around the world are redefining the meaning of old people,"" said Chen Liang-kung (陳亮恭), Geriatrician at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. He believes as people live longer and healthier, using the age of 65 to define the retirement age and categorize people into a group that needs to be taken care of, loses its footing.

Chen believes the key to alleviating the burden the aging population puts on the health care system is to shift the goal of health care. Taiwan's geriatrics should work to prevent the elderly from developing disabilities, such as malfunctioned organs or mobility issues, rather than merely curing their illnesses.

A disease's influence tends to be underestimated: diabetes might shorten a patient's life for two years but will cause him eight years of kidney dialysis before he passes away. In total, the disease places eight years of disability and strain on the health care system.

""According to clinical experience, we know that many chronic diseases will just occur as people age, but we can decide when it will happen and minimize the time of disability and dementia that seniors might suffer,"" Chen argued. This approach means people can actually systematically free up capacity of the health care system.

Chronic diseases also cast a vast demand for personal care. In 2019, more than 260,000 foreign personal care workers supported Taiwanese households by taking care of the elderly and disabled. If another devastating pandemic were to reach Taiwan, these care takers would be unable to tend to the tens of thousands of elderly across the country.

Chen pointed out that rethinking how medical services function would be the first step to more efficient hospitals: many medical facilities have implemented integrated outpatient services to provide one-stop clinics for patients with multiple chronic diseases. These services allow doctors to provide holistic, informed medical advice to patients to make sure their ailments would not deprive them from remaining self-reliant.

In addition, this new measure could preserve more medical resources as the Taiwanese elderly can visit clinics up to 30 times per year on average, according to Chen.

04/8/2020,"Taipei, April 8 (CNA) A technical cooperation effort between Taiwan and Denmark has produced a testing device for the COVID-19 coronavirus that shows the results in just 12 minutes, but it is still in the clinical trial stage, Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology announced Wednesday.The device, dubbed ViroTrack COVID-19 IgM/IgG, was developed by a joint startup BluSense Diagnostics, with funding from Taiwan, the ministry said while unveiling the test kit at a press event.All it requires is one drop of blood (30 ul) from the patient, and the ViroTrack can produce a result within 12 minutes, indicating whether the person is carrying the virus or has recovered from a COVID-19 infection, the ministry said.In an initial clinical trial last week, 15 blood samples were tested at Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark, and performance of the device was 90 percent in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, according to BluSense Diagnostics.Further clinical trials will be conducted next week at Italian hospitals, with the aim of obtaining certification in the European Union in May and releasing the device on the Taiwan market by June, the company said.ViroTrack is portable and easy to use, which makes it suitable for COVID-19 screening at ports of entry, Deputy Science and Technology Minister Shieh Dar-bin (謝達斌) said at the press event, adding that he hopes it can be supplied to countries that have limited testing capacity.The device will be also be valuable in contact tracing in communities to identify asymptomatic patients, according to BluSense Executive Vice President Jessie Sun (孫偉芸).ViroTrack works by checking the human antibodies immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to determine the stage of infection, according to BluSense Diagnostics Chairman Filippo Bosco.IgM is the largest human antibody and usually the first to appear in the response to initial exposure to an antigen, while IgG is the most prolific and acts as protection against bacterial and viral infection.In COVID-19 cases, IgM appears around the 4th day of the infection, which means it can indicate suspected cases, while IgG shows up on the 10th day or later, giving an indication of whether the patient has been infected or is recovering, Bosco said.With the help of those indicators, medical professionals can determine whether a patient has recovered and can be discharged from the hospital, which is much more efficient than the current polymerise chain reaction (PCR)-based tests, he said.At present, PCR and antibody testing are the main forms of COVID-19 testing globally, while ViroTrack uses blood serum, according to Shieh.BluSense Diagnostics, a startup jointly funded by Taiwan and Denmark, has its biochemical research base in Copenhagen and its hardware and software development and research center, as well as a manufacturing plant, in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan.(By Su Ssu-yun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202004080025
04/8/2020,"Taipei, April 8 (CNA) Taiwan's government has decided to requisition 3 million N95 masks per month - the country's total monthly output - to ensure a stable supply for medical workers amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.On average, medical workers in Taiwan use 30,000 to 40,000 N95 masks a day, and there are no worries at present about a shortage of supply, the MOEA official, who declined to be named, told CNA.Nonetheless, the government is still requisitioning the masks -- 1.5 million every two weeks -- based on advice from Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure the safety of medical personnel, the official said.The official did not offer any further explanation of why the CDC felt it necessary to requestion Taiwan's total domestic N95 mask capacity given that domestic demand has fallen far short of that.The four companies in Taiwan capable of producing N95 masks have a combined capacity of 100,000 to 105,000 per day, the official said.That capacity will go up by about 20,000 N95 masks a day when one of the four producers adds new production lines by the end of April, according to the official.The government first requisitioned N95 masks, which can filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles and are mainly used by medical workers on the front lines, on Feb. 6, according to a local mask supplier, and planned to requisition 2.1 million of them from Feb. 17 to March 17.The N95 masks are much more time-consuming to make than the regular medical-grade face masks that are widely used by most workers and residents to combat the spread of the virus.Economic Affairs Minister Shen Jong-chin (沈榮津) told reporters on Monday that N95 masks require four times the amount of melt-blown non-woven fabric that are needed for a standard medical-grade mask, of which Taiwan now produces 15 million a day.Though enough of the raw material exists to produce both types of masks in their current quantities, Shen said the ministry would adjust the output of the masks in the future based on the progression of the epidemic should the demand for N95 masks or regular surgical masks rise sharply.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004080017

04/8/2020,"Taipei, April 8 (CNA) Lawyers representing Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) on Wednesday filed an administrative litigation, seeking the court's review of whether a recall vote against him should be allowed to proceed.In the filing, Han's legal team said the groups that initiated the petition to recall him contravened the relevant law during the signature drive, which on Tuesday reached the threshold to allow a recall vote in June.The groups began collecting signatures long before Han had been in office for one year, which contravened Article 75 of the Civil Servants Election and Recall Act, Han's lawyer Yeh Ching-yuan (葉慶元) and former Kaohsiung city spokesman Anne Wang (王淺秋) said.Wang further argued that a recall vote, which is expected to cost NT$110 million (US$ 3.65 million), would be a waste of taxpayers' money and would also be a risky exercise at this time during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The legal team, therefore, filed an administrative litigation in the Taipei High Administrative Court and at the Executive Yuan, seeking a review of the Central Election Commission's right to proceed with a recall vote against Han, despite the success of the petition in obtaining the required number of signatures.The Central Election Commission (CEC) declined to comment on the move by Han's lawyers, saying only that it will hold a committee meeting on April 17 to verify the signatures on the petition.Meanwhile, one of the leaders of the recall movement Aaron Yin (尹立) said Han's lawyers apparently had misinterpreted the law. The Civil Servants Election and Recall Act states that a recall proposal can only be filed against a civil servant who has been in office for more than one year, but it does not prevent the collection of signatures beforehand, Yin said.He said his organization, WeCare Kaohsiung, put forth the recall proposal on June 27, 2019, after Han announced his presidential bid less than six months into his mayoral term, angering many Kaohsiung citizens who thought he was not giving priority to running the city.Han, the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate in the Jan. 11 presidential election, lost to the incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) by a margin of more than 19 percent.When the recall petition was launched against Han last year, the KMT said it was politically motivated, and the party drew attention to the fact that Yin had served as head of the Kaohsiung City Cultural Affairs Bureau from 2016-2018 under former Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu (陳菊) of the DPP.Under Taiwan law, once the CEC confirms the required number of signatures and verifies them in what is now the second stage of process, a recall vote must be held within 60 days.In order for the result to be valid, at least 25 percent of voters -- about 580,000 in Kaohsiung - must participate in the recall vote, and a recall becomes valid if a majority votes in favor of it.On Tuesday, the Kaohsiung City election commission announced that the petition to recall Han has passed the required threshold in the second stage of the three-step recall process.Under the Civil Servants Election and Recall Act, the first stage in the recall process is to submit a proposal containing the signatures of 1 percent of the constituency's eligible voters.In the case of Kaohsiung with an estimated 2.28 million eligible voters, that means 22,800 signatures, which the recall groups collected and passed on to the CEC for review on Jan. 17.In the second stage, the recall initiators had 60 days to collect the signatures of at least 10 percent of the eligible voters in Kaohsiung, or around 228,000 people.The signatures collected in the first phase are not considered valid in that stage of the process. The recall initiators ultimately collected more than 550,000 signatures in 40 days and sent around 400,000 to the city's election commission for verification on March 7.(By Lin Chang-shuan, Wang Cheng-chung and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004080015

04/9/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved Google's plan to use a U.S.-Taiwan undersea telecommunications cable on Wednesday (April 9), but banned the section between the U.S. and Hong Kong.

U.S. authorities allowed Google to operate a portion of the 8,000-mile (12874.75 kilometers) Pacific Light Cable Network System (PLCN) between the U.S and Taiwan after blocking its previous plan that included the maintenance of the U.S.-Hong Kong route.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) told the FCC it believed, “there is a significant risk that the grant of a direct cable connection between the United States and Hong Kong would seriously jeopardize the national security and law enforcement interests of the United States,” Reuters reported.

According to the news outlet, Google and Facebook had helped pay for construction of the now completed telecommunications link but never received approval from U.S. authorities to use it. The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, trade war, and security concerns between the U.S. and China made the cable connection to Hong Kong a controversial decision.

The partial approval from the FCC came after Google's warning that it may have to seek alternative cable options at drastically higher prices if the agency blocked the whole plan.

The search engine giant admitted it had to meet internal demand for data transmission between the U.S and Taiwan, especially to connect Google's Taiwan data center with its counterparts in America and to serve users throughout the Asia-Pacific region.

As China is a major source of overseas students, it could make recruitment efforts even harder, Chen said.Chen also noted that the number of Chinese students studying in Taiwan has dropped since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came into power.Now that China has stopped Chinese students from coming to Taiwan, it is not impossible the number of mainland students here could fall to zero, Chen said, adding that he hopes this situation can be avoided.(By Lai Yen-hsi, Chen Chih-Chung, Phoenix Hsu and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202004090026

04/10/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese are raising funds for a full-page advertisement in The New York Times newspaper to refute the World Health Organization (WHO) chief’s recent accusations against Taiwan.

During a press conference at the United Nations health agency’s headquarters in Geneva on Wednesday (April 8), WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus took aim at Taiwan. He claimed to have received racist remarks and death threats, attributing the attacks to Taiwanese.

“And Taiwan, the foreign ministry also, they know the campaign. They didn’t disassociate themselves. They even started criticizing me in the middle of all that insult and slur, but I didn’t care,” said Tedros, who had been asked to comment on U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of the organization.

Tedros’ accusations spurred a public outcry on social media and drew protests from the Taiwan authorities. The fundraising campaign was started on Friday (April 10) in the hope of financing a full-page advertisement that will appear in The New York Times next Monday (April 13).

Tedros’ accusations are “a piece of appalling and world-class fake news,” said campaigners on the fundraising page. Media and people around the world watching the press conference could be misled by Tedros’s statement and thus misunderstand Taiwan, they added.

The advertisement will contain a firm rebuttal of Tedros’ claims, in addition to messages that urge international organizations to include Taiwan. In recent years, Taiwan has met with increasing difficulty to take part in the WHO, International Civil Aviation Organization, or Interpol activities, as Beijing ramps up pressure on those international organizations.

“We condemn acts of discrimination, and we extend our respect toward those who have experienced bully, discrimination, negligence, and indifference,” said the campaigners. “Taiwan itself has long suffered similar treatment in the international community,” they added.

The fundraising campaign was initiated by a group of Taiwan's independent media companies, YouTubers, and designers who refer to themselves as #ThisAttackComesFromTaiwan. The hashtag has been used by Taiwanese netizens who began bombarding Twitter and Facebook with photos of Taiwan cuisine and landscapes as a response to Tedros’ claim that Taiwanese had been attacking him.

The campaign aims to garner NT$4 million (US$131,880) within 18 hours. It had received 20 percent backing as of press time.

“I strongly protest the accusations today that Taiwan is instigating racist attacks in the international community,” said Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) on Thursday (April 9). “For years, we have been excluded from international organizations, and we know better than anyone else what it feels like to be discriminated against and isolated,” said the incumbent president, who went on to say the country remains committed to making contributions to the international community.

“@DrTedros said there's ""No need to use #COVID19 to score political points. We agree! Yet without evidence, #Taiwan is accused of orchestrating personal attacks,” said Taiwan' foreign minister via Twitter. “[Tedros'] claim is baseless, without merit & further marginalizes the good work in which the @WHO is engaged worldwide.”",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3913992

Oh, to be the other “Tiger” on Netflix.

Alan Yang's “Tigertail” is either blessed to arrive in the stormy wake of “Tiger King,"" or doomed to be the other “Tiger” title Netflix users accidentally select when they're looking for the tabloid story of a zoo owner, not a patient and personal immigrant tale.

Yang's film, he has said, sprang from both the upbringing of his Taiwanese father and his own imagination. It's a gentle and pensive intergenerational story about love and leaving home, about how an immigrant father's experiences might not be as distant from his first-generation daughter's as he imagines.

“Tigertail,” which debuts on Netflix on Friday, is the directorial debut of Yang, a writer-producer on “Parks & Recreation” and a co-creator of “Master of None."" On the latter, with Aziz Ansari, Yang often stretched sitcom-like comedy in unpredictable arthouse directions.

In “Tigertail,” he has dispensed with the comic set-up and gone straight for the arthouse, striving for the kind of lyricism of Wong Kar-wai or the elliptical beauty of Hou Hsiao-Hsien. Yang's film, heartfelt but inert, only briefly touches on anything like the work of those filmmakers. But it's an earnest stab at a drifting kind of memory piece that crosses generational divides, from Taiwan to New York.

The movie's most vibrant images come early. It opens on a young boy running through shining rice fields in rural Taiwan. The boy, Pin-Jui (Tzi Ma), grows up to be a factory worker. He reconnects with a girl he met in those fields, who becomes his first love. Their scenes together, dancing, are handsome. But when Pin-Jui is given the opportunity to go to America, it comes with the bargain of an arranged marriage, to a woman named Zhenzhen (Fiona Fu).

These scenes are overlaid with contemporary ones of an older Pin-Jui and his grown daughter, Angela (Christine Ko). She is navigating her own heartbreak but finds her stoic father indifferent to her pain. His reflections of his past play out as a withheld history that, if he relents, could bond them.

“Tigertail” comes off more as an idea of an arthouse movie than one propelled by its own volition. While the 1960s-set scenes have a warm glow, the modern-day ones are flat. We've been blessed lately with films that chronicle multi-generational tales, straddling Asia and America, like last year's “The Farewell” (in which Ma also co-starred) and the upcoming Sundance winner “Minari.” “Tigertail” doesn't rise to the level of those movies, but it contributes to a heartening trend.

“Tigertail,"" a Netflix release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for some thematic elements, language, smoking and brief sensuality. Running time: 91 minutes. Two stars out of four.

She tested positive for the coronavirus on April 8, CECC records showed.Meanwhile, a COVID-19 patient in his 70s died Thursday, the CECC said.The man, who suffered from underlying conditions, was part of a tour group that visited Egypt from March 3-12, the CECC records showed.He started displaying symptoms on March 17 and was confirmed positive on March 19, the CECC said.The man's condition started to deteriorate on March 20 when he suffered breathing difficulties and was transferred to the intensive care unit, the CECC said, adding that he passed away April 9.Ninety-one of Taiwan's COVID-19 patients have been released from quarantine, while six have died.

At a news conference on Wednesday, MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Head, Baushuan Ger (葛葆萱), said that Taiwan will be donating over 1 million surgical masks to NSP countries. Ger said that although there are 18 NSP countries, Taiwan is currently only preparing to donate face masks to those countries which have informed them of a need.

When asked how many countries have requested masks, Ger estimated there are ""seven or eight"" thus far. A source familiar with the matter told CNA that seven of the countries to have requested masks include the Philippines, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Singapore.

Ger said the total number of masks allotted to NSP countries will surpass 1 million, but he did not specify how many would be distributed to each country. In addition, Taiwan will be sending 1 million masks to its 15 diplomatic allies, 2 million to the U.S., and 7 million to 11 European countries.

Singapore is suddenly facing an increased need for face masks as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on April 3 stated the government will ""no longer discourage people from wearing masks,"" reported The Online Citizen. Lee said the policy change had been made as more evidence had been gathered about the ability of asymptomatic patients to transmit the disease.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – If the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic lasts beyond the summer, Taiwan could find it hard to see its economy grow by even just 1 percent, business leaders said Friday (April 10).

Most forecasts from before the pandemic saw Taiwan’s Gross Domestic Product expand by at least 2 percent during 2020, though as the virus started affecting more countries, economists and institutes started adjusting the figure downward to just above or under 2 percent.

Speaking in Taipei Friday, General Chamber of Commerce (全國商業總會) Chairman Lai Cheng-yi (賴正鎰) said that original expectations had been that the pandemic could be brought under control by the end of March. In that event, Taiwan’s GDP growth would have ranged from 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent. However, that was not the case, with the number of deaths growing rapidly around the world, CNA quoted the businessman as saying.

If the pandemic lasts beyond the summer until the end of the year, Taiwan’s economy would find it hard to grow even by just 1 percent, according to Lai. One of the main reasons would be that demand in the United States and Europe would remain weak because of the ravages caused by the coronavirus, leaving Taiwan with shrinking markets for its exports.

At present, several sectors of the Taiwanese economy are suffering, with restaurants seeing their business drop by more than 80 percent, hotels by 75 percent, and launderettes by at least half, according to Lai.

While the government has launched a package worth more than NT$1 trillion (US$33.28 billion) to support the economy, the business leaders said it might be enough to help enterprises extend their life but not to fuel a real revival.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3913951

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Just like Luckin Coffee and TAL Education, another United States-listed Chinese firm, iQiyi, has come under fire for allegedly faking key data about its performance, reports said Friday (April 10).

The allegations of fraud and forged data at several Chinese companies comes as doubts persist about the Chinese government’s handling of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which turned into a pandemic after cover-up attempts by Beijing.

It read:""News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, CHINA.

Chen said.Chen also asked whether China, as a WHO member, informed the world health body of the seven cases.If the Chinese did not notify the WHO, ""what else would be called a cover up?"" he asked. ""If (the Chinese) did report it, what else would be deemed a dereliction of duty (on the part of the WHO)?""In repeated statements to international and local media, as well as at news conferences, Taiwan's officials, including from the health and foreign ministry, had said it warned WHO of the possibility of human-to-human transmission in the email it sent to the WHO on Dec. 31, when the COVID-19 outbreak first came to public knowledge.On Friday, international media, including the Agence France-Presse, a news agency based in Paris, reported that the WHO denied Taiwan's claim that it mentioned the possibility of human-to-human transmission in its email.Responding to this, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) accused the WHO of ""garbling the email content"" in a phone interview with CNA Friday night.Chuang said Taiwan learned about the emergence of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan on Dec. 31, 2019, which was later known as COVID-19, and immediately alerted the WHO and the Chinese side through email, requesting them to verify.Atypical pneumonia is what China commonly referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Chuang said, stressing that the disease itself, also caused by coronavirus, is transmittable from human to human.Although Taiwan did not ""directly"" point out the possibility for human-to-human transmission in that email due to confused information at that time, its email ""strongly hinted"" of such a scenario based on the characteristics of SARS and observations that patients in China were isolated, Chuang said.In a press conference held on March 24, CECC officials claimed that the WHO failed to pass on its warning in the Dec. 31 email about a possible human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus to other countries.Taiwan's claims of its early warning has led to a diplomatic row between the United States and China, and fueled Washington's criticism of the WHO.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus supported Taiwan's claim in a recent Twitter post and blamed Chinese authorities' refusal to admit human-human transmission until Jan. 20 for the ""catastrophic consequences"" of COVID-19.A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman and other Chinese spokespersons have rejected such claims, arguing that China had taken effective and strong measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down the entire Hubei province of 58 million people, where the outbreak was first discovered.The WHO's website states that on Dec. 31, WHO's China office was informed of several cases of unknown pneumonia, and by Jan. 3, Chinese authorities had informed the WHO of 44 cases: https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/U.S. officials and others have also criticized the WHO for saying there was only limited human-to-human transmission as late as Jan. 14 and not announcing the virus could be transmitted from person to person until 10 days later.The WHO, however, has argued that it actively dealt with the outbreak, getting information from China and seeking details on its own, while also passing on findings to the global community.Meanwhile, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA）reiterated on Saturday that Taiwan's tightening of virus preventive measures, including the screening on airline passengers from China right after the email was sent, was indeed implemented based on the assessment that the emerging disease was transmittable between humans.The MOFA reiterated that Taiwan, as a member of the international community, has the ability and the willingness to cooperate with international partners in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus and to contribute to the health and welfare of all mankind.The U.S., Taiwan and the WHO, including its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have been locked in a word war on the accountability of the spread of the coronavirus and Taiwan's participation in the WHO.Taiwan is not a member of the WHO because of China's objections and it lost its observer status in the WHO's World Health Assembly in the past few years due to tense relations between the current administration and Beijing.Taiwanese officials have argued that its exclusion means it cannot easily obtain information from or share its expertise with the WHO about disease outbreaks or other health issues.(By Chang Ming-hsuan and Emerson Lim) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004110004

The campaign emerged after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a news conference on March 8 accused Taiwan of personal attacks and “racism,” comments which set off a storm of indignation on the island. Tedros has been criticized for helping China downplay the seriousness of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and not just by Taiwan.

On Friday (April 10), YouTube personality Ray Du (阿滴) and graphic designer Aaron Nieh (聶永真) launched the campaign to raise funds for a full-page ad in the April 13 edition of The New York Times under the theme “#ThisAttackComesFromTaiwan,” a parody of the WHO chief’s complaint.

The plan for their open letter was to collect NT$4 million within eight hours after Friday’s 1:30 p.m. launch, but they reached their target by 10 p.m., CNA reported. By Saturday morning, the total stood at NT$10.28 million.

In a reaction to the campaign’s overwhelming success, Du said that due to the limitations the coronavirus pandemic might impose on the distribution of newspapers, they were considering paying for an online ad instead. He promised that all the money which had been collected would be spent on the ad, either by extending its duration or by adapting its content, CNA reported.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3914436
04/11/2020,"Taipei, April 11 (CNA) The first-quarter sales of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, exceeded its earlier guidance, mainly on record high revenues for March.The strong first-quarter sales reflected solid global demand for 5G applications and high performance computing (HPC) devices, which has offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the typical slow season effects, according to market analysts.In a statement released Friday, TSMC posted about NT$310.60 billion (US$10.32 billion) in consolidated sales for the January-March period, up 42 percent from a year earlier but down 2.09 percent from the previous quarter.The company's first-quarter sales beat its estimate of NT$304.98 billion to NT$307.97 billion, which was made at an investor conference in mid-January.In March alone, TSMC's consolidated sales totaled NT$113.52 billion, a new monthly record that was up 21.5 percent from the previous month and 42.4 percent from a year earlier.In addition to the strong demand for 5G and HPC devices, an increase in the number of working days in March also helped generate the record high sales, analysts said.TSMC has scheduled an investor conference for April 16 to detail its first-quarter results and give sales guidance for the second quarter. With the COVID-19 pandemic showing no immediate signs of easing, investors are expected to ask the company for further assessments of negative effects on the global semiconductor industry down the road.Gartner and IC Insights, two global market information providers, have warned that sales in the global semiconductor industry will drop this year due to the pandemic, with the former predicting an annual 0.9 percent decline and the latter forecasting a 4 percent decrease.According to analysts, pure wafer foundry operators, including TSMC, are unlikely to meet an earlier combined annual sales growth target of over 17 percent in 2020, due to the coronavirus.At TSMC's upcoming investor conference, it is also expected to announce whether its capacity expenditure budget for 2020 will remain at between US$15 billion and US$16 billion.Earlier this week, TSMC announced plans to raise NT$21.6 billion by selling unsecured company bonds to finance the construction of a new production site and expansion of its production capacity, after a bond sale of NT$21.4 billion in March.Analysts said the proceeds from the new bond sale will be used to finance TSMC's efforts to develop advanced 5 and 3 nanometer processes at its plants in the Southern Taiwan Science Park.The company is set to launch mass production of 5nm chips in the first half of this year and 3nm chips in 2022. Currently, its most advanced chips in mass production are 7nm.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202004110012

04/12/2020,"Taipei, April 12 (CNA) Media visibility and direct messaging could be the motives behind the frequent appearances of Chinese and American military assets near Taiwan, especially as they are both struggling with the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, according to analysts in Taiwan.Between January 23 and April 10, Chinese military aircraft were spotted at least six times flying near Taiwan's airspace, according to the records of Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) and military air movement tracker Aircraft Spots.On Sunday morning, Chinese aircraft carrier the Liaoning passed the Miyako Strait south of Japan and was about to sail into waters east of Taiwan on its way to the South China Sea.Meanwhile, since March 25, U.S. military aircraft and vessels have been seen at least nine times near Taiwan.Lin Ying-yu (林穎佑), an assistant professor at National Chung Cheng University's Institute of Strategic and International Affairs, told CNA on Saturday that the presence of American and Chinese military assets in the area was an indication of increased propaganda efforts by both countries and more frequent flexing of their muscles to boost morale at home, as they have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.He noted that a Chinese military helicopter crashed in Hong Kong on March 30, less than a month after a military plane crashed in China, which he said raised the question of whether the capabilities of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) had been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.In contrast, Taiwan has been gaining international visibility as a result of its relatively successful COVID-19 control measures and donations of personal protective equipment to other countries, Lin said.This may have forced Beijing to think about some action to warn Taiwan against ""taking advantage of the pandemic"" to move toward independence, he said.Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), senior analyst at the Institute of National Defense and Security Research, said China has expanded its maritime and air presence in the Indo-Pacific region through actions such as aiming missiles at U.S. military facilities in the region and militarizing civilian fishing boats to challenge government vessels from Taiwan and Japan.The U.S. has responded by increasing the presence of its military aircraft and warships in the region, Su said.He said it is worth noting that the U.S. has been responding more frequently and readily to the PLA's movements in the area and has been engaging in ""military public diplomacy"" via social media to convey its message directly to the public.However, Chieh Chung (揭仲), research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight, thinks that that an accidental military encounter between the two giants is unlikely.They both seem to be deliberately staggering their military maneuvers in the region, Chieh said. They follow rules agreed upon, and communications between their high-level military officials and decision-makers seemed unimpeded somehow, he said.""In light of those factors, while there is a possibility of such a scenario, it is within a controllable level,"" Chieh said.(By Chen Yun-yu and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004120012

The symptoms disappeared after he took some over-the-counter medication, but on arrival in Taiwan on April 10 he was tested and showed up positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, the CECC said.The female patient, meanwhile, is the wife of a confirmed COVID-19 case, and the couple returned to Taiwan on April 2 after a three-month trip to the U.K to visit relatives, the CECC said.While in home quarantine, the woman, reported that she had lost her sense of taste and smell, and she later tested positive, while her husband was confirmed on April 6 to have been infected with the coronavirus disease, the CECC said.

04/12/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Singaporean first lady Ho Ching (何晶) sparked a controversy Saturday (April 11) when she responded to Taiwan's donation of masks to the Southeast Asian nation with a less-than-enthusiastic ""Errrr.""

In a Facebook post in which she shared a Taiwan News article titled ""Taiwan to donate medical masks to Singapore,"" Ho left the online community puzzled by her onomatopoeia. Many Taiwanese have called her out for being ungrateful and urged their government to retrieve the masks, while Singaporean netizens have apologized on Ho's behalf, saying they are just as perplexed by her reaction.

On Wednesday (April 8), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced that Taiwan would be donating over one million surgical masks to Singapore and other New Southbound Policy (NSP) countries to help slow the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The island nation has already donated millions of masks to 11 European countries and the U.S., who in return have offered sincere gratitude, reported CNA.

Since being posted, Ho's comment has stirred up a heated debate between some Taiwanese netizens and their Singaporean counterparts. A few Chinese internet users have also joined the fray and mocked Taiwan for politicizing the situation.

Supporters of Taiwan have pointed out that the post was highly inappropriate for Ho, the wife of Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (李顯龍), to make. However, some Singaporeans have defended Ho, saying that the Taiwanese government had not supplied Singapore with masks in January, when they were needed the most, reported ETtoday.

On Sunday (April 12), MOFA reaffirmed its decision to send masks to Singapore and said the friendship between the two countries will not be affected by individual comment.

Unfortunately, the game was mistaken by a baseball writer as having occurred in China, due to the misleading first word of the league's name: the ""Chinese"" Professional Baseball League (CPBL).

The season opener in Taiwan has attracted heavy international media attention, as all the world’s sporting events have come to a halt during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions, of Tainan, beat the home team Chinatrust Brothers, 4-1, according to CBS Sports.

“Kai-Wen Cheng, an outfielder with the Uni-Lions, hit the first home run of the CPBL season in the first inning. That means, by extension, Cheng hit the world's first meaningful home run of the year,” the report said.

NBC Sports shared the video of the homer on its official Twitter account, with the caption, “A real life home run from a real live professional baseball game!”

American journalist Jared Carrabis also shared the home run video on his Twitter account, with the accompanying text, “We are playing baseball in China. There is hope.”

04/13/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Passengers who had been on the first of two flights that brought Taiwanese nationals back from China last month were able to return home Monday (April 13) after 14 days of quarantine.

In order to evacuate nationals stranded in China's Hubei province due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the Taiwanese government arranged flights for them through China Airlines on March 29 and 30. The first batch of 153 passengers was released Monday morning after spending two weeks in quarantine, reported CNA.

The quarantine site, located between New Taipei and Taoyuan, had been planning for a stream of vehicles since early morning, hoping to successfully transport the newly released patients back to their homes. Meanwhile, police conducted security checks and directed traffic in the surrounding area.

Many of the patients' family members arrived at the quarantine site before 5 a.m.

Each person had their temperature checked and underwent disinfection at a checkpoint before being released. At 6:00 a.m., many were picked up by their families, while others took buses to the Taoyuan High Speed Rail (HSR) Station or the Taoyuan Airport MRT line to get home.

“It was an easy ordeal,” according to Wu (吳), an evacuee who had been China for nearly three months and locked down in Hubei for more than 70 days.

Wu, who had already bought a house in Hubei, explained that he had been visiting relatives with his wife on Jan. 15 and that he had not expected to stay for so long.

After Taiwan had announced the two flights, many people hired cars and traveled from Hubei to Shanghai in order to board the flight home. The taxi fare alone cost nearly RMB$1,500 (USD$212.73) per person.

After returning to Taiwan, he was placed under quarantine for 14 days. Wu stated that the meals provided at the quarantine site were very lavish and that the staff members were all extremely nice.

“Even if you can’t eat because of physical discomfort,” he said, “the staff will still give you some bread or instant noodles at night.”

As his son, who was also held up in China, was about to take the college entrance examination, the two of them hurried back to Taiwan first. Wu’s wife, who has not yet obtained a Taiwanese identity card, stayed in Hubei but said that ""Taiwan is the safest place in the world.""

While stuck in China, Wu’s son worried that he would not be able to keep up with school assignments. During this period, however, students offered support and encouragement, and each day's lessons were sent to him online by classmates.

04/13/2020,"Taipei, April 13 (CNA) Taiwan's military is planning to spend millions of dollars to design and build its own military-use powered exoskeleton suit that is expected to begin production in 2023, according to the Defense Ministry's budget proposal for fiscal year 2020.The ministry's Armaments Bureau has allocated NT$250 million (US$8.3 million) in 2020 for use in developing a powered exoskeleton system, a mechanized wearable system that gives users greater strength and endurance when performing physical tasks.A military source told CNA that the military is hoping the high-tech suits can be used in wartime and in post-disaster rescue and relief missions, and they are expected to enter the production stage in 2023.The source said the project expects to learn from the U.S. military's experience in developing its own powered exoskeleton suit to increase the mobility and reduce the fatigue of its users, which could prove particularly helpful during combat or rescue missions.The suits can provide support to users in carrying taxing loads over long distances or reduce stress on leg muscles, the source said.Explaining the rationale behind the project, the source said only a handful of world powers, including the U.S., Japan, and Canada, are currently working on similar technology for military use, and their technology is not available at present for confidentiality reasons.Most of the powered exoskeleton suits available on the market right now are designed for medical and industrial use only and not suitable for military purposes, giving reason to Taiwan to try to develop its own equipment.Another key is that the suits need to be tailored to a wearer's body size, and those made in foreign countries may not fit the regular height and weight of Taiwanese soldiers, according to the source.The Armaments Bureau said it is now working closely with a number of private medical technology, automation and robotic companies, and a number of local universities, and the military's top research institution, the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCIST, 中山科學研究院), on the project.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004130018
04/13/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After Thai netizens found themselves embroiled in a massive flamewar with Chinese on Twitter, they used self-deprecating humor to counter insults hurled by their online adversaries.

Over the weekend, Chinese netizens discovered to their dismay that Thai actor Vachirawit Chivaaree, also known as ""Bright,"" who is the star of the hit TV soap opera ""2gether,"" is not actually gay like the character he portrays but has a girlfriend. His love interest was revealed to be actress Weeraya Sukaram, who goes by the nickname ""New"" and the Twitter handle ""nnevvy.""

Bright retweeted a photographer's images and wrote ""taken from 4 countries,"" one of which was Hong Kong. When Chinese netizens saw the retweet, they became enraged and called Bright out for labeling the special administrative region as a country.

Bright then apologized to Chinese followers for improperly labeling Hong Kong as a country. However, Thai netizens came to his defense, as they felt he had done nothing wrong.

Next, a Chinese netizen dug up a photo New had taken in Taiwan with Bright, commenting that she is a ""cute Chinese girl."" New replied ""What?"" in Thai, which in this context was a way to coyly express embarrassment.

Unfortunately for New, Chinese readers interpreted it as meaning that she was disappointed for being compared to a Chinese woman. A friend of New's then asked what style of dress she was wearing, and she responded ""Taiwanese style.""

Chinese netizens then combined New's perceived disappointment with being referred to as Chinese and her description of the outfit as ""Taiwanese"" as an affront to China and proceeded to accuse her of supporting Taiwanese separatists.

Chinese netizens then found that New had previously retweeted a post stating that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) had originated in China, which contradicts what Chinese have been told by their propaganda outlets: that the disease started in the U.S. Fury reached a fever pitch, and they began hurling insults at Thailand, with the hashtag #nnevvy soon becoming a battlefield on Twitter.

Instead of directly counter-attacking with insults of their own, Thais posted countless memes showing people being completely unphased by the best that Chinese trolls could throw at them. For example, a meme taken from the film ""Finding Neverland"" shows the character Peter, played by Freddie Highmore, crying and asking why Thais are not hurt by Chinese insults, to which Barrie, played by Johnny Depp, replies ""cultural difference, just stay in the wall.""

Many of these Chinese netizens criticized the Thai government, but Thais retorted that they frequently criticize their government on their own. One said that Thailand is poor, and a Thai responded that China is ""Pooh,"" as in Winnie the Pooh, to whom Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping (習近平) has frequently been compared..

Another tactic used was to shoot down Chinese Communist Party (CCP) talking points with censored facts and history. Soon, citizens of Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and others joined forces with the Thais with memes of their own.

He will team up with Wayne McNeil to present the CPBL to fans around the world at a time when professional baseball has all but come to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic.""In many ways baseball is a way of life, and being able to have a baseball season means that Taiwan is still able to have a normal way of life,"" Wang told CNA.In addition to reflecting the country's success at stopping the spread of the virus, it is also hoped that broadcasting the games in English will show the world the pandemic can be overcome, he said.Having previously served for 14 years in the CPBL's department of promotion and marketing, official publications, strategic planning, and international affairs, Wang said he hopes to help international fans fall in love with Taiwan baseball.""I think the fans will be interested in the players' skills and I will also fill in with background and stories about the league,"" he said. ""But I do hope, maybe later in the season, fans will be allowed into the stadium, which will show the complete package the CPBL has to offer.""When asked if the English broadcasts will continue for the rest of the season, Wang said it depends on viewership and he thinks that there is a good chance it will be received well.The last time the CPBL was broadcast to an international audience was over 30 years ago.The 2020 regular season will run until Oct. 14, with a total of 240 games scheduled, according to the CPBL website. The other teams in the CPBL are the Taichung-based CTBC Brothers and Yunlin-based Wei Chuan Dragons.

His love interest was revealed to be actress Weeraya Sukaram, who goes by the nickname ""New"" and the Twitter handle ""nnevvy.""

Bright started things off by inadvertently implying that Hong Kong is a separate country in a tweet, quickly upsetting sensitive Chinese fans. The fact that he had to apologize for such a minor detail spurred Thai netizens to leap to his defense.

Next, a Chinese netizen dug up a photo New had taken in Taiwan with Bright, commenting that she is a ""cute Chinese girl."" After she seemingly condemned the notion of being Chinese and responded to a friend that she was wearing ""Taiwanese style"" clothing, Chinese netizens became enraged.

Fury reached a fever pitch, and they began hurling insults at Thailand, with the hashtag #nnevvy soon becoming a battlefield on Twitter. Instead of directly counter-attacking with insults of their own, Thais posted countless memes showing people being completely unphased by the best that Chinese trolls could throw at them.

Over the ensuing days, other nationalities have sided with the Thais and posted memes of their own, including netizens from Japan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. On Tuesday, Twitter user Amazing (@this28644469) posted a painting commemorating the Seymour Expedition led by British Admiral Seymour during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.

The original painting depicted a bust of Seymour overlooking waves of soldiers from the Eight-Nation Alliance bravely charging towards Chinese Boxers. In the new version, Seymour has a flag of Thailand imposed over his head, symbolizing the Thais leading the online campaign, while the flags of the Philippines, Japan, India, British Colonial Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan fly over the soldiers of the ""New Eight-Nation Alliance (2020).""

As an overwhelming force of online warriors surges forward in the ""Nevvy War on Twitter,"" a sole Boxer can be seen making an obscene comment in Chinese as an Eight-Nation soldier prepares to deliver a fatal shot. In the caption, Amazing made it clear that Taiwan is different from China and supported the freeing of Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet. He then thanked Thais for standing up to China and called for the bombing of the Great Firewall of China.

Ironically, the Seymour Expedition was a failure, but this was soon succeeded by the Gaselee Expedition which eventually overpowered both Boxer and Qing army forces to sack Beijing and force China to pay reparations for the uprising. The punitive expedition has often been cited by communist Chinese leaders as an example of humiliation suffered at the hands of foreign oppressors and a justification for protectionist trade policies.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3916050

04/14/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) on Monday (April 13) announced that ID-based medical mask machines will be expanded to all of the city's districts next week.

After Taipei launched three ID-based mask vending machines on a trial basis in an effort to alleviate the long lines for medical masks, on Sunday (April 12), Ko on Monday announced the machines would be rolled out across Taipei's 12 districts next week. Based on the ratio of child to adult masks sold, Ko said the new machines will only sell adult masks to accelerate the transaction process and shorten queues.

Ko said that if all goes well during the trial, each machine should be able to sell up to 60 masks an hour. As there are currently three machines on trial, they can sell 180 per hour, and over the course of 10 hours, that would translate into 1,800 masks, reported CNA.

The machines are the result of a collaboration between the city government's technical task force, industry players, and the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA). On the first day of operations on Sunday, long lines formed behind the machines throughout the day, prompting Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) city councilor Chien Shu-pei (簡舒培) to question if the mayor had overhyped the machines, causing people to have unrealistic expectations about the wait involved.

After having inspected the first day of trial operations, Ko said that he thought the lines that formed were tolerable, but joked the purchase method amounted to an ""e-payment cram school,"" according to the report. Ko said the area for queuing needs to be adjusted and the machines should be placed back indoors.

According to sales statistics, only 15 percent of customers purchased children's masks, while 85 percent bought adult masks. Ko said the city is considering shifting the sale of children's masks to drugstores and only stock the machines with adult masks, so as to eliminate the need to choose between the two sizes, which takes up more time.

The machines require users to first insert their National Health Insurance (NHI) card before using a smartcard or app for payment, including Apple Pay, Google Pay, Line Pay, JKOPAY, EasyCard and cash. However, Ko said that one glitch that has been encountered is that when individuals insert their NHI card and swipe a contactless smart card too close together — the similar beeping sounds making it hard to tell which of the cards had just been read.

Ko said that many people think the first beep for the NHI card indicates the payment has been made, stopping them from continuing to swipe their smart card and resulting in a failed transaction. Ko recommended the machines only issue a sound when payment has been made.

He said another bug was the NHIA system not being notified of the purchase until the money had been deducted from the user's account. He said in some cases, this enabled people to purchase masks from both the machines and at drugstores in person, while the current ration only allows one purchase of nine masks every two weeks.

Ko said that he is coordinating with the manufacturers to ensure the machines will not sell masks until the user's NHI card successfully synchs up with the NHIA system.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3915960

During his daily press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Health Minister and Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) head Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) announced there had been zero new coronavirus cases detected in the country that day. He said the last time Taiwan had reported no new cases was March 9, meaning that Taiwan had gone 36 days with at least one coronavirus case per day.

The vast majority of cases reported over this period were imported from other countries as Taiwanese citizens fled from hotspots in Europe, Asia, and North America. Many feared these imported cases would bring a second wave of domestic infections to the country.

Fortunately, it appears the CECC's efforts at quickly identifying, isolating, and tracing the contacts of confirmed cases have held the virus at bay — for now. In other good news, Chen said all 214 of the Taiwanese citizens evacuated from Hubei province via charter plane in late March had been released from home isolation and begun self-health management.

In a Facebook post uploaded on Tuesday evening, the Grand Hotel Taipei announced that the famous landmark had formed the word ""zero"" with its rooms to ""tell all of Taiwan and the world that we did it!"" It then pointed out that bringing the number down to zero was no easy task and that continued vigilance is essential.

The hotel wrote that reaching zero was accomplished not only through the efforts of ""all the heroes,"" but also the result of teamwork across Taiwan. The post closed by encouraging everyone to continue their hard work and emphasizing the importance of coming together to defeat the disease.

That same day, the Grand Hi-Lai Hotel in Kaohsiung used its hotel room windows to form a giant smiley face. On its Facebook page, the hotel wrote that it had created the smiley face to celebrate the first time zero cases had been reported in 36 days and promised to display new patterns depending on the news about the outbreak in the future.

04/15/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As pride in Taiwan is on the rise for its handling of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, members of a Taiwanese Facebook group have pinpointed three spots in New Taipei City where face masks with Taiwanese flags on them are being sold.

A member of a Taiwanese Facebook group that specializes in information on face masks on Monday (April 13) announced that she had received several 3D polyurethane masks with the Taiwanese flag when purchasing her biweekly ration of masks. She wrote that ""big kids"" and adults can wear them but that they are too small for children.

She wrote that her masks were not for sale but that she would be willing to swap them for other unusual styles. A flurry of comments followed, with some claiming to have received the masks at pharmacies in New Taipei City's Shulin and Tucheng Districts as well as in the National Taipei University area of Sanxia District.

On Wednesday (April 15), another member of the group posted a photo of more masks emblazoned with the country's flag and asked others to comment if they had received any, but none of those who responded had. One person said that they had seen a pharmacy in front of Shulin Train Station selling them two days before.

Another person said that these masks are issued at government-contracted pharmacies and that the factory is in New Taipei City's Yingge District. They claimed that the factory supplies drug stores in Shulin and Tucheng.

In February, as fears over the coronavirus outbreak reached a fever pitch and Chinese purchases of face masks rapidly began to deplete the global supply, an image on social media showing masks guaranteed to keep Chinese away due to the presence of the dreaded Taiwanese flag quickly went viral. As some Taiwanese netizens pointed out, the face masks can indeed be purchased on the Champ Mask website in adult and child sizes in packages of 5 masks each, with 200 packages per box.

In early March, Ruptly posted a video interview with a representative of a factory in Taoyuan who said that sales of their Taiwanese flag masks were selling as fast as they could make them, and that they had had to triple production to meet demand.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3916661

Please understand our grief and indignation,"" Liu Ta-ching (劉大經) and Claire Wang (王婉諭) said in the statement.The couple also thanked the public for its support and said they will continue to work to mend the ""social safety net"" so that every child can grow up safely.Claire Wang, who became a prominent social activist after the death of her daughter, now serves as a New Power Party legislator.Wang Ching-yu was first sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shilin District Court, a ruling that was later upheld in both a trial and a retrial at the High Court.The Shilin District Prosecutors Office had originally sought capital punishment for Wang, although subsequent court rulings decided against this, as Wang was diagnosed with schizophrenia.As his schizophrenia could improve with the right treatment, which would reduce the chances of him reoffending, the High Court decided against sentencing him to death, it said after Wang's retrial.The High Court also said at the time that Wang's life sentence was not reduced despite his mental disorder, because doctors determined that he was cognitively normal and able to control himself when he committed the murder.According to the court, Wang had made meticulous plans to carry out the attack, and he waited for the most opportune moment to strike. Afterwards, he was able to describe to the police the process of the murder in detail.Wang, therefore, did not meet the qualifications stated in Article 19 of Taiwan's Criminal Code that list mental illness as possible grounds for a commuted sentence.After the retrial, both the defense and the prosecution filed for an appeal. The defense questioned the testimony of medical personnel, while the prosecutors raised doubts as to why the High Court imposed the same sentence at the retrial even after it deemed certain grounds for reducing Wang's sentence from death penalty to life sentence inapplicable.The Supreme Court, however, dismissed both appeals as without merit.(By Hsiao Po-wen and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004150025

(TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, said Thursday that it remains upbeat about its business outlook and is expecting sales growth of 19 percent this year, despite the economic impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.At an investor conference, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei (魏哲家) said the company is optimistic about demand for emerging technologies such as 5G applications and high performance computing (HPC) devices.TSMC also has confidence in its advanced processes and is likely to outperform the wider semiconductor industry this year, Wei said, forecasting an annual sales growth of 14-19 percent this year for the company.With the global semiconductor industry feeling the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, its 2020 sales are unlikely to meet the earlier estimate of 8 percent annual growth, and instead will either stay flat or drop slightly, Wei said, adding that the forecast does not include memory chipmakers.In the pure foundry sector, the 2020 sales growth will not meet the earlier projection of 17 percent but will range between 7 and 13 percent, he said, responding to questions by institutional investors.At the investor conference, TSMC reported a 0.8 percent sequential increase and 90.6 percent year-on-year growth in its first-quarter net profit to a record NT$$116.99 billion (US$3.90 billion).TSMC's earnings per share for the first quarter was NT$4.51, up from NT$4.47 in the fourth quarter of last year.Analysts said that solid demand for 5G applications and HPC devices helped TSMC weather the usual first-quarter slow season as well as the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.According to Wei, TSMC is expected to continue to benefit from its efforts to develop chips on advanced processes, and it is projecting that its 7 nanometer, 7-plus nm and 6nm processes will make up about 30 percent of its total sales in 2020.He said the 5nm process, which went into mass production this year, will contribute 10 percent to TSMC's total sales this year.Citing TSMC's upbeat business outlook, Wei said the company has decided to retain its 2020 capital expenditure plan at between US$15 billion and US$16 billion, the highest in its history.At the investor conference, TSMC CFO Wendell Huang (黃仁昭) said the company is expected to post US$10.1 billion to US$10.4 billion in consolidated sales for the second quarter, a sequential decline of only about 1 percent, as 5G and HPC applications will help the company weather the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the slow season.An earlier market estimate had projected a 5 percent quarterly drop in TSMC's second-quarter consolidated sales.Huang said TSMC's gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- is expected to range between 50 and 52 percent in the second quarter, compared with 51.8 percent in the first quarter.The company's operating margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- for the second quarter is forecast at 39-41 percent, compared with 41.4 percent in the first quarter, according to Huang.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202004160024

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — While United States President Donald Trump was still downplaying the importance of wearing face masks against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the National Security Council (NSC) approached Taiwan to obtain masks for senior White House officials, the Washington Post reported Thursday (April 16).

In mid-March, the Trump Administration insisted that only front-line medical personnel should wear masks while healthy people did not need them. However, officials at the White House were worried about an allegedly limited number of the face coverings available to staff there.

Matt Pottinger, a top deputy at the NSC familiar with Asian affairs and with SARS, struck a deal with Taiwan to import thousands of masks just two weeks before the administration reversed its policy and recommended the wearing of the coverings, according to the Washington Post.

Pottinger first mentioned the subject in a call with Taiwanese officials on March 14, and just days later, the island announced it would ship 500,000 masks to the U.S. While most of those ended up in the strategic national stockpile, the NSC decided to set aside 3,600 masks for the White House. Half of those were destined for the body’s own staff, with the other half to be distributed by the White House medical unit to other employees at the complex, the Washington Post reported.

The White House denied there ever was a shortage of masks, as three quarters of staff were now working from home, and enough face coverings were left to adequately service the senior officials needed to run government.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3917466

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The World Medical Association (WMA) wrote to the World Health Organization (WHO) calling for Taiwan to be allowed to attend the World Health Assembly (WHA), reports said Friday (April 17).

The letter followed growing questions about the handling of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been accused of toeing the Chinese government’s line while engaging in a war of words with Taiwan.

According to the WMA letter, the virus outbreak has “illustrated with terrible consequences how wrong and damaging for global health it is to exclude Taiwan from unrestricted and effective participation in the World Health Organization.”

Both during the 2003 SARS crisis and the current pandemic, the WHO failed to pay sufficient attention to Taiwan, leaving the world “paying a high price,” said the letter signed by WMA Council Chairman Frank Ulrich Montgomery and WMA President Miguel Jorge.

The WHO should “make a fresh start” for the upcoming WHA by opening its doors to a Taiwanese delegation and stop playing political games, the letter cautioned.

Taiwan has been repeatedly praised for its handling of the pandemic, with Friday being the third day within a week that no new cases of the coronavirus have been reported. The island counts a total of 395 cases, including six deaths, figures far lower than many WHO member nations.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3918327

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Foreign citizens who entered Taiwan before March 21 will be allowed to extend their stay by an additional 30 days without having to file an official application, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday (April 17).

As the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic decimates air travel and countries impose restrictive immigration rules, many travelers who have been trapped overseas are unable to respect official residency deadlines. MOFA has already allowed foreign visitors one 30-day extension, with Friday's announcement now allowing for a total extension of 60 days.

The new measure applies to all foreigners who entered Taiwan legally before March 21, regardless of whether they did so visa-free, with a visa on arrival, or with any other official visa, as long as they have not overstayed yet, CNA reported.

Nevertheless, MOFA cautioned that a person's stay could not exceed 180 days, with the first full day after arrival being counted as day one.

In the case of overstayers, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) has a program, valid from March 20 to June 30, during which people who voluntarily report to the authorities will not be detained and will receive the lowest possible fine.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3918055

Therefore we are worried about a trend in the rise in the number of infections,"" Chen said.The new quarantine regulations follows on from the same requirements that went into effect Saturday for Taiwan citizens and other residents returning from Europe or the Americas, Chen said, adding that some 18 returnees were admitted into quarantine hotels that day.(By William Yen) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004180012

There is the participation within the WHO governance process, within for example, the WHA, and that's an issue that member states of the organization decide,"" Solomon said.""But within the technical work... there are a range of areas that we cooperate, work with, engage with Taiwanese experts, both within the context of this current pandemic and generally,"" he said.Ryan said, ""We are bringing the Taiwanese colleagues into the networks, the technical networks, so they can share their experience,"" and added that the WHO stands with professional, scientific and health experts everywhere.In a statement, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledged the WHO's praise of Taiwan's efforts in fighting the coronavirus and reiterated its call for the WHO to set aside politics and allow Taiwan to participate ""fully"" in the WHO.As of Saturday, Taiwan had reported 398 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with six fatalities.(By Tang Pei-chun and Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004180008

And we will do it together"" said Tsai, in the video that also showcased Taiwan's efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed the desire of the country and its citizens to help in the international community.Since January this year, Tsai has been tweeting regularly about Taiwan's efforts to combat COVID-19, including the country's donation of millions of surgical face masks to health care workers in countries around the world.The posts have received widespread attention and boosted her Twitter following by 40,000 in the last week alone.The push for higher Twitter follower numbers intensified in early March, when Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Deputy Secretary- General Sidney Lin (林鶴明) called for more Taiwanese to follow Tsai on Twitter and ""tell our side of the story"" to the world, instead of allowing the story to be told by China.Twitter also appears to be a place for Tsai to engage with other world leaders.

While the front was anticipated to fall in Taiwan on Tuesday, it will send the mercury to as low as 15-16 degrees on Friday, and will also bring rain to the island, the meteorologist predicted.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3918970
04/19/2020,"Taipei, April 19 (CNA) Vice President Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁), an epidemiologist by training, feels social distancing will became a way of life amid the COVID-19 outbreak for at least another 18 months, the time it will take to develop a vaccine.According to a transcript of Chen's interview with the Daily Telegraph posted on the Presidential Office's website Sunday, Chen believed mankind ""won't get rid of this virus totally"" because it is highly contagious with many mild or asymptomatic cases and can be transmitted through droplets and contaminated areas.There is therefore a need to develop rapid diagnostics and anti-virals to treat the cases, with milder ones to be treated by private practitioners and severe ones to be treated in medical centers, he said.""Maybe in one and a half years, we may have a vaccine... But before that, we definitely have to keep social distancing,"" he said.Chen suggested that as long as people live in a ""self-limited way"" by cutting their social contacts in half, then a ""semi-normal"" lifestyle can still be achieved.On reopening travel and trade, Chen said all nations must share data and make their outbreak status transparent so that international transportation can be coordinated.Studies on antibodies and blood sample testing will be needed to know the infection status of each country, he said.As to when will life return to normal, Chen admitted it was difficult to predict accurately as he sees the outbreak in Europe has having reached its peak and on the way down while it is still going up in the United States.Nevertheless, ""all nations are mobilized, and they are doing much better than one month ago. It's a kind of good phenomenon of globalization, COVID-19 containment,"" he said.In the interview, he also expressed reservations about the contention that the new coronavirus originated from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a live animal market in Wuhan.""If we look back at all the reports among the first 42 cases published in academic journals, around 10 of them have no history of going to Huanan Seafood Market,"" he said.(By Yeh Su-ping and Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004190006
04/19/2020,"Taipei, April 19 (CNA) China might take advantage of the power vacuum in the region following the halt of overseas movements by the United States military, but a military offensive against Taiwan is unlikely, according to a Taiwanese defense analyst.""The U.S. military deployed in the western Pacific has been a force that secures the safety of the region. Whether China sees the halt of U.S. military movement as an opportunity to take, is a national security issue worth watching,"" said Chang Jung-Ming (章榮明), a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR).According to foreign media reports, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper ordered in March a ban on troop movements overseas for 60 days, in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the military.Currently, four U.S. aircraft carriers assigned in the Indo-Pacific region are all quarantined at different ports, and war games such as Balikatan 2020 held by the U.S. and the Philippines and the Large Scale Exercise 2020 were also postponed.Writing in the latest issue of Defense Security Weekly on April 10, Chang pointed to the possibility of China taking actions in the region to test the U.S.'s reaction or establish ""facts on the ground"" as future bargaining chips.He cited two incidents, one on March 30, in which a Chinese fishing boat collided with the Japanese destroyer Shimakaze in the East China Sea, and another on April 2, in which a Chinese Coast Guard ship collided with and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat in the South China Sea, as examples of such actions.However, U.S. air assets continue to operate near Taiwan even after the stop movement order, Chang said, with American war planes appearing in the region at least five times between March 25 to April 8.""On March 31, U.S. war planes flew over the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea in the same day,"" he said, concluding that the stop movement order would only minimally affect Taiwan.On the possibility of an armed attack by China against Taiwan, Chang said the current environment did not favor such a move, especially with the international community unhappy with China's lack of transparency in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.Other factors precluding such an attack would be its lack of legitimacy because Taiwan has not broken the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chang argued, and he also felt the fear of a defeat that would undermine the authority of China's leadership was at play.At the same time, conquering Taiwan is not the top priority of the Xi Jinping (習近平) administration, which is focused on getting people back to work and preparing for a possible second-wave virus outbreak.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202004190013
04/19/2020,"Taipei, April 19 (CNA) A new round of flights have been arranged for the coming days to bring back 460 Taiwanese nationals and family members who have been stuck in Hubei province in China because of the new coronavirus outbreak since late January.Taiwan's government has contracted with state-controlled China Airlines (CAL) to bring back 230 Taiwanese each on flights scheduled for Monday and Tuesday nights, according to a statement by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), the country's top policy-making body on China.The two flights are scheduled to depart from Shanghai's Pudong International Airport at 7:50 p.m. and arrive at Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport at 9:50 p.m. on the two nights, the statement said.The Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a semi-official organization that handles cross-strait affairs in the absence of formal bilateral links, is now contacting the 460 people to make sure they are ready to travel.The foundation wants to see if they have prepared valid travel documents and if they will be able to make it to Shanghai on time to be ready to board the two flights, the statement said.The people in Hubei are being forced to catch the flights to Taiwan from Shanghai because Taiwan and China have been unable to agree on arrangements for charters from Wuhan to Taipei.After the CAL flights land in Taiwan, the passengers will be sent directly to designated sites to be quarantined for 14 days before being allowed to return home.The flights will be the fourth round of evacuations of Taiwanese nationals and family members who had been stuck in Hubei province and its capital city Wuhan, the Chinese epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, since they were sealed off in late January.The first three rounds of evacuations brought back around 1,000 people from China.The first charter flight on Feb. 3 evacuated 247 individuals, and two flights on March 10 and March 11 brought home 361 people.On March 29 and 30, two CAL flights, called ""charter-like"" flights by Taiwan's government, ferried another 367 people back to their homes in Taiwan.The Chinese province lifted restrictions on outbound travel on March 25 after being on lockdown for several weeks, while the lockdown of Wuhan was lifted on April 8, according to Chinese authorities.(By Lai Yen-hsi and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202004190014

04/20/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A bench-clearing brawl broke out during a Taiwanese professional baseball game on Sunday (April 19), getting extra attention from the outside world as Taiwan is the only country with active professional sports games during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

A melee broke out during a Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) game on Sunday when a pitcher from the Fubon Guardians intentionally struck a batter from the Rakuten Monkeys. The incident drew praise from baseball fans for livening up what has been a boring period, with most of the world's professional leagues sidelined by the coronavirus.

The conflict started when Kuo Yen-wen (郭嚴文) told an umpire that the Guardians were using an illegal bat. Umpires halted play to inspect a bat for having an illegal marking on it.

Officials decided that the image of a human head on a strange animal body was not illegal, and play resumed. Angry at Kuo's accusation, Guardians pitcher Henry Sosa then threw three pitches ever closer to Kuo before finally hitting him on the buttocks with the fourth.

As soon as Sosa's pitch connected, both teams swarmed onto the field and started pushing and shoving each other. After the dust settled, the umpires decided not to eject any players and allowed the game to continue.

In the end, the Monkeys defeated the Guardians with a score of 3 to 1. Bored out of their socks over the past few weeks, several international sportscasters were pleased to see the fracas break out.

ESPN sports commentator Keith Olbermann wrote, ""Today, in Taiwan, the CPBL had a beautiful bench clearing brawl."" Meanwhile, George Jarjour from Sports ON Tap wrote ""The Rakuten Monkeys from Taiwan give us our much needed benches clearing brawl.

Today, in South Korea, the KBO has hope.

04/20/2020,"Taipei, April 20 (CNA) Export orders received by Taiwan-based companies in March grew more than 40.4 percent from the previous month to US$40.26 billion despite the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday.That represents an increase of US$11.58 billion in export orders from February and year-on-year growth of 4.3 percent, the ministry said.It also brings first quarter export orders to a total of US$104.24 billion, a 23.1 percent drop from fourth quarter export orders last year, and a year-on-year decrease of 3.5 percent, according to MOEA data.Due to the global impact of COVID-19, the ministry forecast in February that export orders in the first quarter would be US$97.5-US$99 billion.According to Huang Yu-ling (黃于玲), director of the MOEA's Department of Statistics, export orders secured by the information and communications industry in March rose 6.9 percent from last year, partly due to the reopening of factories owned by Taiwanese businesses in China.Those factories, which were mostly closed in January and February as part of Chinese efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, have now reopened and are processing previously delayed orders, Huang said.Another reason behind growth in the industry is increased demand for phones and computers, as more people are having to work and learn from home amid the pandemic, Huang said.In the electronic components industry, export orders were up 23.8 percent from last year, largely due to the continued increase in demand for 5G applications and high-performance computing devices, according to Huang.Meanwhile, the plastics/rubber and chemical product industries were clearly affected by the pandemic and declining crude oil prices, Huang said.Export orders in both sectors suffered double-digit declines from a year earlier, with a decrease of 11.6 percent and 19.8 percent respectively, Huang said.As to forecasts of the value of export orders in April, Huang said it was likely to be lower than March, largely due to uncertainty surrounding the European and U.S. markets as the pandemic continues.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202004200020
04/20/2020,"Taipei, April 20 (CNA) The number of furloughed employees in Taiwan topped 15,000 last Friday due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Deputy Labor Minister Liu Shih-hao (劉士豪) said Monday.As of April 17, 636 companies had unpaid leave programs, while a total of 15,634 workers had agreed to go on furlough, nearly double the number of workers reported to be on furlough as of April 1, according to Liu.That is the most for any reporting period since the formal unpaid leave system began in 2011 under which companies must reach furlough agreements with workers and pay them at least the minimum wage (currently NT$23,800).At the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, before the formal reporting system was put in place, the number of workers on unpaid leave peaked at nearly 239,000 in February 2009.To support workers on furlough, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) has rolled out a program that offers free training to furloughed workers as well as subsidies to companies that run training programs for their employees, Liu said at a legislative hearing.A total of 62 companies and 2,086 workers have benefited from this program so far, Liu said.Meanwhile, Taiwan's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year can definitely surpass 1.0 percent despite the global coronavirus pandemic, Chu Tzer-ming (朱澤民), head of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), said Monday.According to DGBAS predictions, if the pandemic lasts for nine months and the government doesn't roll out corresponding measures, economic growth will fall by 1.8-2.3 percentage points, leaving growth at 0.4-0.9 percent for the year, Chu said at a legislative hearing.But government measures taken to help businesses and workers get through the adverse affect of the outbreak should lessen its toll on the economy and help GDP growth reach 1.3-1.8 percent, Chu said.At the same legislative hearing, Yen Tzung-ta (嚴宗大), deputy governor of the Central Bank, said the pandemic has caused much uncertainty, which has been reflected in predictions of Taiwan's economic growth.Recent predictions of Taiwan's GDP growth have ranged from the 1.8 percent forecast made by the Asian Development Bank to the minus 4.0 percent projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with a median of 0.5 percent, Yen said.Judging from the data he has seen so far, Yen said the global economy will undergo a U-shaped recovery, meaning that the economy will gradually climb out of the current slowdown instead of experiencing a sharp rebound.(By Wu Po-wei, Pan Tzu-yu and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202004200017
