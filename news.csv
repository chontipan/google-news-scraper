03/1/2020,"Taipei, March 1 (CNA) A woman who was evacuated from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has been diagnosed to become Taiwan's 40th confirmed COVID-19 coronavirus case, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said Sunday.The newest patient is a woman in her 70s who lives in northern Taiwan, the CECC said.The woman boarded the cruise ship Jan. 20 and was originally diagnosed with coronavirus Feb. 15 after the ship was quarantined off Yokohama since Feb.4, even though she did not show any respiratory issues, the CECC said.She was hospitalized in Japan Feb. 16 and then returned to Taiwan Feb. 26 after two tests showed she was negative for the virus, the CECC said.Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), CECC chief, said the woman wore a mask the whole time on the flight and was separated from other passengers with nobody sitting within two rows in front of or behind her.After disembarking from her flight she was taken by ambulance to be quarantined at a hospital, with the latest test result showing her to be positive for the coronavirus, Chen said.CECC expert Chang Shang-chun (張上淳) said the woman originally showed negative on her first test, then an unconfirmed result on her second test, which was followed by a positive result on her third test.One of the reasons for the negative tests to later turn out to be positive may have been that toward the end of a particular treatment, the virus level may have dropped low, affecting the tests detecting the virus, Chang said.This is why some international reports have shown that people who are believed to be been cured and have been discharged from hospital later turn out to be positive, he said.Meanwhile, three more patients in Taiwan who were infected with coronavirus were discharged from hospital after recovering from the disease, the CECC said Sunday.The discharged patients were a female tourist from China, the wife of a Taiwanese businessman from Wuhan -- the epicenter of the virus -- and an imported case from Macau.This brought the total number of people who have been discharged after being hospitalized for treatment in Taiwan to 12, the CECC said.As of Sunday, there had been 2,192 people suspected of being infected, including 40 confirmed cases, with one death, according to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control statistics. A total of 2,059 people had been cleared of infection, with the remainder awaiting test results while under quarantine.(By Chen Wei-ting, Chang Hsiung-feng and William Yen) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003010008

03/1/2020,"Taipei, March 1(CNA) Minister Without Portfolio Lin Wan-i (林萬億) said Sunday that it would be best to give new functions and implications to the National Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall, seen by some as a symbol of authoritarianism, instead of dismantling it.Lin, tasked with overseeing issues related to the transformation of the hall, made the remarks after renewed calls from families of the 228 Incident victims to dismantle the structure.There is no timetable yet for the fate of the CKS Memorial Hall as the Ministry of Culture(MOC) is still compiling relevant files with relation to the transformation, Lin said, adding that inter-department meetings will be convened for discussion after the MOC submits its recommendation.There are many suggestions regarding the transformation of the memorial hall, issues such as the structure's new name, new functions and how to deal with the late President Chiang Kai-shek's statue, Lin said,Suggestions from the victims' families will be respected, but at the same time, these suggestions should be viable, Lin said.Asked if dismantling the memorial hall is an option considered by the government, Lin reiterated that the best thing to do is to give new functions and positive implications to the structure instead of removing it or deserting it.The CKS Memorial Hall, a 250,000-square-meter tourist attraction in the heart of Taipei, was completed in 1980 in Chiang's memory, former leader of the Republic of China who moved his government to Taiwan in 1949 after fleeing China following his defeat in the Chinese civil war.However, families and relatives of political persecution victims during the martial law period under Chiang have been calling for the dismantling of the memorial hall as they see Chiang as a human rights violator who should not be treated as a national hero.""We all know that the (statue of the) persecutor is inside the structure,"" Liao Ying-hao (廖英豪), grandson of a political victim of the 228 Incident, a civil uprising that began Feb. 28, 1947 that led to a bloody government crackdown, said during a commemorative event Friday.""It remains a stab in the heart for the victims unless the structure is removed,"" he said, urging the government to make a decision soon.Liao described Chiang as the principal culprit of the 228 Incident.On the other hand, Presidential Office spokesman Ting Yun-kung (丁允恭) said Friday that the Legislative Yuan is currently working on a plan to remove the autocratic characteristics of the CKS Memorial Hall.Ting said the government will eventually come up with a solution on the future of the CKS Memorial Hall that can promote social reconciliation and the country's unity.(By Gu Chuan, Wen Kuei-hsiang and Emerson Lim) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003010010
03/1/2020,"Taipei, March 1 (CNA) More than 20 people are now staying at two quarantine hotels in Taipei under an initiative by the city government to house individuals who have to undergo quarantine but do not have a place to stay in Taiwan.The individuals include Taiwanese businessmen who work in China, as well as people traveling from Italy and South Korea to Taiwan, Commissioner Liu Yi-ting (劉奕霆) of Taipei's Department of Information and Tourism said Saturday.None of them have any symptoms of the COVID-19 coronavirus, Liu stressed, and they are paying for their own stays.As part of efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, all individuals entering Taiwan from China, South Korea and Italy have to undergo 14-day home quarantine upon entry.Those in quarantine are not allowed to leave their homes and are subject to daily health checks by their ward chiefs.The Taipei City government has received reports, however, that some visitors have not been permitted to stay at hotels they had booked in advance because they had to undergo quarantine, which spurred the launch of the initiative.Under the plan, individuals who have displayed no COVID-19 symptoms are allowed to stay at these designated quarantine hotels.Those who do have symptoms are awaiting COVID-19 test results, or have had contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients will be placed in medical institutions if they have nowhere to stay in the country.Currently, two hotels that are providing 40 rooms in total are cooperating with the city under the plan, and two more are expected to join next week, Liu said.The hotels have to pass inspections from Taipei's Department of Health, Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Civil Affairs before they can receive such visitors, Liu said.Regarding the name and location of the hotels, Liu said that Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) has not instructed that these information be made public.Liu also stressed that these hotels remain safe for regular guests staying there, as those in quarantine are placed on different floors.Only hotel employees who are in charge of delivering food to and collecting waste from quarantined individuals are allowed to enter the floors they are staying on, he said, and since these individuals are not allowed to exit their rooms, regular guests are perfectly safe.Even if a hotel runs on a central air conditioning system, which neither of the hotels do, it will not contribute to the spread of the disease, Liu said, adding that he has confirmed this with the city's health department.The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, and there is no evidence so far to indicate that it can spread through airborne transmission, Liu said.According to a Department of Health press statement released Feb. 27, no housekeeping is provided to quarantined individuals during their stay. Instead, the hotels provide them with enough towels, bedsheets and pillowcases in their rooms, as well as cleansing products.When these individuals check out, amenities including shower gels, toothbrushes and slippers will be immediately disposed of, and cleaning staff will be outfitted with masks, gloves and goggles when disinfecting the rooms, the statement said.(By Chen Yi-hsuan, Liang Pei-chi and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003010011

Initially, it plans to test 10 animal samples daily and expand its testing capacity further depending on the development of the epidemic.However, the COA stressed there is no evidence that pets can become infected or transmit the virus.It advised pet owners to follow proper sanitation and hygiene habits, such as washing hands thoroughly after touching their pets, and to help their pets stay healthy.(By Chang Hsiung-feng and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003010007

03/2/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB) announced on Monday (March 2) that it has successfully completed the synthesis of favilavir, a drug that could be potentially used to treat Wuhan coronavirus,

The DCB said that in the future, it would work with cGMP manufacturers to produce sufficient antiviral drugs for patients, according to a CNA report.

DCB deputy director Chuang Shih-hsien (莊士賢) said that the center focused on synthesizing favilavir, which was developed by a Japanese pharmaceutical company and approved for sale in Japan in March 2014. The drug is mostly used to treat flu patients who do not respond to Tamiflu and Relenza Rotadisk, the report said.

Favilavir has been used by both Japan and China to treat severe cases of COVID-19, and the DCB team expects it to become a significant drug in treating the disease, according to the report.

DCB president Herbert Wu (吳忠勳) said that the center was able to synthesize the drug in four days after acquiring its components and that the goal is to transfer the process to domestic companies so they can mass-produce a generic version to fight the epidemic, per CNA.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3884063
03/2/2020,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) The Netherlands Trade and Investment Office in Taiwan (NTIO), which represents Dutch interests in the country in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, said Monday it will fund a program to cultivate local talent for Taiwan's offshore wind energy development.At a news conference, Guy Wittich, head of the NTIO, said based on the good relationship between the Netherlands and Taiwan, the Dutch government approved a talent cultivation program at the end of 2019.Under the program, Wittich said, the Dutch government will fully fund the training of trainers in Taiwan by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), the Wind Energy Institute at the Delft University of Technology, and Water Research Institute Deltares.Wittich said with Taiwan's first offshore wind farm becoming operational last year, renewable energy development in the country has entered a new stage.Efforts to cultivate talent have become critical to the offshore wind energy industry in Taiwan, the NTIO said, which is why it has teamed up with National Taiwan University (NTU) and the Metal Industries Research & Development Centre (MIRDC) to carry out the program.The NTIO said National Cheng Kung University and National Sun Yat-sen University are also likely to take part.According to the NTIO, more than 10 Dutch companies, most of them in the marine engineering industry, have invested in Taiwan and these investors, recognizing the lack of local talent, suggested the Dutch government should set up a talent cultivation program locally.In the first stage, the program will cultivate 20 trainers, the office said.The office did not disclose the size of the funding the Dutch government will provide.In response to the program, Weng Su-chen (翁素真), chief secretary of the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), said the MOEA is planning to set up an offshore wind energy training center in Kaohsiung at the end of this year and she hopes trainers from the Dutch talent cultivation program will join the training center, which aims to cultivate about 500 trainees in the initial phase.According to a recent survey conducted by the NTU Energy Research Center, Taiwan will need about 20,000 offshore energy development professionals by 2025.

03/2/2020,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) The number of workers on unpaid leave in Taiwan rose sharply to 1,604 in the last two weeks of February, due mainly to the effects of the novel coronavirus outbreak on the economy, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) said Monday.As of Feb. 29, the number of workers who had agreed to go on furlough jumped by 735 to 1,604, compared with 869 in the first two weeks of February, according to MOL statistics.Meanwhile, the number of employers implementing unpaid leave also increased in the second half of February, spiking from 22 in the previous two weeks to 40, the MOL data showed.During the 15-day period, three employers ended their unpaid leave programs, but 21 others launched new programs agreed upon by management and employees, bringing the total to 40, the data showed.More than 50 percent of the companies with employees on unpaid leave in the last two weeks of February were businesses in the metal/electromechanical industry, including the manufacturers of parts and components and machine tools, according to Huang Wei-chen (黃維琛), deputy director of the MOL's Department of Labor Standards and Equal Employment.Most of the companies implementing unpaid leave are small enterprises with a workforce of fewer than 50 people, and their unpaid leave programs typically last for less than three months, with their employees each agreeing to take up to four days of unpaid leave per month, according to the MOL.The latest figures reflect the effects of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on the country's tourism/hospitality, restaurant and catering, and wholesale and retail industries, Huang said.The MOL said, however, that employers have been instructed to pay their furloughed employees at least NT$23,800 (US$795) per month, which is the minimum wage, so that the workers can maintain their living standards.The ministry's Workforce Development Agency has in place a program to subsidize companies that offer on-the-job training to furloughed workers to upgrade their job skills, he said.Under the program, employers can apply for subsidies to hold training sessions, with each employee eligible to receive NT$158 per hour for attending a maximum 120 hours of training per month, according to Huang.(By Chang Hsiung-feng and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003020014
03/2/2020,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) A public health expert on Monday advised people to embrace social distancing measures to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.While the number of confirmed diagnoses of the acute respiratory disease are rising around the world, Taiwan can help minimize the threat by applying social distancing as used in other countries, said Chen Hsiu-hsi (陳秀熙), vice dean of National Taiwan University's College of Public Health, during a press conference in Taipei.One such approach is to keep a distance of at least one meter between people as practiced in Finland, he said, adding that even when Finns line up at the bus stop, they still keep roughly that distance between each other.""I had a chance to be a visiting professor in Finland in the past and it was very interesting,"" Chen said. ""If there was a free seat next to someone on the bus, Finnish people would rather go sit somewhere else further away.""Chen said the social distancing model could be a good idea for people in Taiwan and other countries to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.South Korea reported over 800 new coronavirus cases Saturday and one of the main reasons is because a church sect in the country's south-eastern Daegu City tightly packs worshippers into its religious services, Chen said.It is not advisable to hold large scale activities at this point in time, but if an event must be held, there are ways to decrease the risk, Chen said.In addition to screening people for fever, event-goers who have a questionable travel history or history of contact with possible infection carriers should be placed at the back which is better ventilated.""If we implement this method in a mathematical model of the scenario involving the church sect in South Korea, the 800 infections drop to a much lower number,"" he said.South Korea has been under international media scrutiny as one of the hardest hit countries outside China -- the origin of the virus -- with another 476 new coronavirus cases reported Monday, hiking its national tally to 4,212 and also increasing the death toll to 22, according to Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics.Meanwhile, in Taiwan as of Sunday, 2,291 people have been suspected of being infected, including 41 confirmed cases, with one death, according to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control statistics.

03/2/2020,"Taipei, March 2 (CNA) The offshore Penghu archipelago is more strategically important than the former frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, a Taiwanese scholar recently said, while calling on the government to bolster Penghu's defenses to prevent a Chinese invasion as losing the islands would imperil the whole country.In a paper titled, ""the Strategic Role of Penghu in the Defense of Taiwan,"" released late January, Paul Huang (黃恩浩), an assistant research fellow at the government-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), called on the nation's armed forces to beef up Penghu's defenses, which play a crucial role in the defense of the country.According to Huang, Penghu or the Pescadores are an archipelago of 90 islands in the Taiwan Strait, and have long been a strategic location, with the Dutch, French and Japanese all launching campaigns against the islands since the 17th century.From an international political point of view, Penghu is the first-line of defense in the so-called ""first-island chain,"" which refers to the major archipelagos on the East Asian continental coast that comprise the Kuril Islands, the Japanese archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the northern Philippines and Borneo.Their strategic location means the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) would have to take the islands in any invasion of Taiwan.According to Huang, Penghu is far more important for Taiwan's defense than the islands of Kinmen and Matsu.Due to their proximity to China, it would be extremely difficult for Taiwan to defend Kinmen and Matsu, which at the closest point are only 2km from China's Fujian Province, Huang said.In contrast, Penghu, which is about 140km from China, has a more strategic role to play in Taiwan's defense, he added.The archipelago is already the most heavily-guarded of Taiwan's offshore islands, according to Huang. Currently, Taiwan has stationed troops on 16 of Penghu's 90 islets.Around 70 of the military's 460 M60A3 tanks are deployed in Penghu, with a Kidd-class destroyer at sea, which could be armed with the RIM-66 Standard missile system, while the islands' air defenses are boosted by Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) jets as well as the Tien Kung surface-to-air defense missile system.Should Chinese military vessels invade, troops in Penghu can also fire Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles, he added.In addition, the 300km range of the radar station at Shiyu Township in Penghu allows early detection of PLA aircraft and vessel movements in the area, covering most of the Taiwan Strait and southeastern coastal areas of China.Huang warned that the loss of Penghu in the event of a cross-strait military crisis could jeopardize the security of the whole nation.As Taiwan is taking steps to build its own submarines, Huang called on the military to deploy submarines in the waters around Penghu in the future to further deter Chinese invasion, which would also help prevent the PLA from crossing the ""first-island chain.""Huang's paper was published on Jan. 21 in the 151st edition of the INDSR's Defense Situation Monthly.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003020023

Among its major factories, the site in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, produces iPhones.Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei Province at the end of December, Chinese authorities have come up with measures to lock down about 50 cities to limit population movement and the spread of COVID-19, a move that has impacted production at many factories.Such large lockdowns in China have raised concerns over iPhone production due to a lack of labor.In response to such worries, Liu said the company has followed the law in terms of production resumption in a bid to protect its Chinese employees.Since the reopening of its factories in China after the Lunar New Year holiday, Liu said production has met more than 50 percent of seasonal demand for the first quarter.By the end of March, production is expected to meet seasonal demand for the quarter, Liu said.Due to lower production in the first quarter, he added Hon Hai expects to receive deferred orders in the second quarter so revenue for the first two quarters of the year will be little changed from a year earlier.However, Hon Hai has lowered its forecast for 2020 sales growth from 3-5 percent made in January to 1-3 percent, Liu said.Before the investor conference, market analysts had forecast Hon Hai's revenue for the first quarter would fall 42 percent from a quarter earlier.(By Chung Jung-feng and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003030018
03/3/2020,"Taipei, March 3 (CNA) A Taipei hospital on Tuesday announced that one of its patients is the longest-living person to have received pioneering heart surgery, the 107-year-old man underwent an operation more than five years ago to replace an aortic valve.According to Cheng Hsin General Hospital, its cardiac surgery team performed Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) surgery on the patient surnamed Chen (陳) when he was 102.The previous record for the oldest living person to have undergone TAVI surgery was a man who had the operation at 99, but passed away before 107, the hospital said.Wei Jeng (魏崢), superintendent of Cheng Hsin General Hospital, said at a press event that the aortic valve usually opens when blood is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body.Aortic stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve does not open and close properly, which can result in breathlessness, chest pain, dizziness and heart failure.About 2 percent of people over 65 suffer from aortic stenosis which jumps to 4 percent for the over 85s, he said.Most of those who suffer from the onset of symptoms die within two years, according to Wei.For people with aortic valve problems, the usual treatment is open heart valve surgery, which has a 97 percent success rate, Wei said.However, for people who are too old or who have other medical problems, open heart surgery may be considered too risky, he added.For those patients, TAVI, a procedure that allows an aortic valve to be implanted using a long narrow tube called a catheter, is considered preferable to open heart surgery, he noted.The cardiac surgery team at Cheng Hsin is one of the most experienced in Taiwan at performing TAVI. Of the 2,200 patients who have received such surgeries in Taiwan, 560 were done at Cheng Hsin, he added.However, Wei also noted that the cost of the TAVI procedure is not covered by National Health Insurance and is relatively expensive. For younger patients, regular open heart surgery is better suited to their needs, he added.(By Chen Wei-ting and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003030021
03/3/2020,"Taipei, March 3 (CNA) Standard Chartered Bank, a leading British banking group, said it has lowered its forecast for Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 to below 2 percent, taking into account the impact of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus originally from the Chinese city of Wuhan.In a news conference, Standard Chartered announced that it expects Taiwan's GDP will grow 1.9 percent in 2020, a downgrade from its previous forecast of 2.2 percent made Feb. 19.The latest forecast by Standard Chartered showed the bank has been downbeat about Taiwan's economic growth, compared with Taiwanese government figures. On Feb. 12, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) lowered its forecast for Taiwan's GDP growth for 2020 to 2.37 percent from 2.72 percent.Tony Phoo (符銘財), a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank for East Asia, said the downgrade of Taiwan's GDP growth forecast by his bank largely reflects concerns that production in China will shrink in the wake of the corornavirus spread.After the virus broke out at the end of December, there have been more than 90,000 confirmed cases reported worldwide, with over 3,000 deaths, the majority of which have been in China.China has stepped up measures to lock down about 50 cities around the country to contain the spread of the virus.The measures include the residents of communities having to register before they are allowed in or out and heavier restrictions that shut down highways, railways and public transport systems, which has limited people and cargo movement and has hindered production.Phoo said Taiwan's manufacturing sector has been highly correlated with its Chinese counterpart, citing data showing that China accounted for 23 percent of Taiwan's semi-finished goods production in 2018.The equity market has feared that the virus spread in China will interrupt a supply chain for Taiwanese electronics manufacturers and in turn affect Taiwan's production and shipments.In addition, Phoo said Taiwan is expected to feel the pinch resulting from the losses in the tourism industry as the country has barred entry by Chinese tourists due to the virus infection concerns.According to Phoo, 27 percent of foreign arrivals in Taiwan came from China in 2019.Phoo said Taiwan's GDP for the first quarter of this year will be affected by the COVID-19 contagion. But Standard Chartered did not give details about the GDP growth from quarter-to-quarter in Taiwan.Chartered Bank said Taiwan is still expected to outperform its neighboring countries. For example, the bank has forecast that South Korea, one of Taiwan's closest competitors, is expected see its economy grow 1.8 percent in 2020.The bank said Hong Kong could see contraction of 2.4 percent in 2020, while Singapore's economy is expected to grow only 0.8 percent.As for China, the bank predicted that the epidemic in China could be eased at the end of March, and after a slow first quarter, the country's economy is expected to bounce back in the second and third quarter.The bank added the China economy is expected to gain support from the Chinese government's stimulus measures which could maintain private consumption, while production is expected to stage a V-shape rebound after the first quarter.Standard Chartered has cut its forecast of China's 2020 GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points from its previous estimate to 5.5 percent. It was the second downgrade of China's GDP growth so far this year.The bank has also lowered its forecast of the global economic growth to 3 percent for 2020 from 3.2 percent.(By Wu Chia-jung and Frances Huang) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003030010
03/3/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The global Wuhan coronavirus epidemic has had a devastating effect on Taiwan's flagship carrier China Airlines, with 6,500 flights for February through April canceled.

The rampant spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world has taken a heavy toll on air carriers. In an open letter to employees, China Airlines' human resources department described the ""avalanche effect"" the epidemic has had on the company's finances, reported UDN.

At present, the airline's planes are only operating at 50 percent capacity on average. The letter asked the company's more than 10,000 workers to take a leave of absence, compensatory leave, and special leave.

The letter then explained that in the month of February alone, 23 percent of the airline's flights had to be canceled, a total of 1,400 flights. This included more than 610 cross-strait routes, 520 Hong Kong routes, 160 flights to northeast Asia, and 60 flights to Southeast Asia, reported NOWnews.

For the month of March, the letter stated that nearly 3,000 of the air carrier's flights have already been canceled, representing 49 percent of the flights originally scheduled. This includes more than 860 cross-strait flights, 902 Hong Kong flights, 860 Northeast Asia flights, and 320 Southeast Asia flights, and more than 60 transocean flights to Europe and the U.S. have also been canceled, according to the report.

At present, 2,100 flights have already been canceled for the month of April, accounting for 33 percent of flights scheduled for that month. The authors of the letter wrote that further cancelations are possible depending on how the epidemic develops.

In the letter, the company said that Hong Kong and Macau routes account for 22 percent of the airline's revenue, while Japan and South Korea routes account for 29 percent. It stated that although it had suffered losses during the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the financial crisis in 2009, the scale of routes affected, the revenue plunge, the number of employees, and operating costs during those times was different from the current ""avalanche effect.""

China Airlines fears that even after the epidemic wanes, the company will need a longer period of time to recoup its losses than in previous crises.

The airline stated that government travel warnings to numerous destinations due to the outbreak have led to extensive flight cancellations. It added that 14-day quarantine regulations in place for travelers arriving from a number of countries have caused passengers to cancel flights to Taiwan.

The airline warned that if its operating conditions continue to deteriorate due to the impact of the epidemic, it will have to launch ""contingency plans."" It closed by exhorting employees to follow prescribed measures to avoid contracting the disease and to not come into work if they are feeling unwell.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3884533

""But in this year's survey, only 10.75 percent of the respondents said the trade dispute has had a large impact on their business.""""Nearly half of the respondents said that the overall impact on Taiwan so far has been mainly positive, due to the return of manufacturing operations from China.""Asked at a press conference Wednesday why the optimism level of U.S. businessmen in Taiwan was higher than last year considering the threats of the coronavirus, C.W. Chin (金奇偉), AmCham Taipei chairman, said that the timing of the poll could be a factor.The survey was conducted at the start of the outbreak and the government has been doing well in controlling the spread of the virus, he said, adding that the handling of the situation had boosted the chamber members' confidence.While commending the government for its controlling of the outbreak, Chin said the impact of the coronavirus crisis to Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) remains to be seen.About 73 percent of the respondents who completed the survey before the seriousness of the outbreak was recognized expressed confidence about the 12-month outlook, but the rate dropped to 53 percent for those who took the survey after the epidemic became evident, according to the report.The survey also found out that more than 30 percent of AmCham Taipei member companies expect to increase employment in 2020 and fewer respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the level of attention that business receives from top policymakers in Taiwan.On the other hand, the respondents identified cross-Taiwan Strait relations, energy policy, labor regulations on working hours and conclusion of a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S. as top priorities in President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) second term.Most AmCham Taipei members see that better cross-strait relations would be beneficial to the business environment, so this could be an initiative for Tsai to work on, Chin said.The survey was conducted Jan. 14 - Feb. 17, receiving 197 effective responses.AmCham Taipei will come up with its White Paper in June, stating its members' concerns and recommendations to the Taiwan government on economic issues.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003040015

03/4/2020,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Taiwan economists said Wednesday that the central bank should maintain its monetary policy in the second quarter, implying that the bank should not follow the United States Federal Reserve's emergency move the previous day to cut interest rates in an effort to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.Lo Wei (羅瑋), chief economist of Fubon Financial Holding Co, said Taiwan has been doing better than many other countries to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, therefore, it is unnecessary for the local central bank to ease its monetary policy anytime soon.""It would be best if Taiwan's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged for the time being,"" Lo said, ahead of the bank's quarterly policymaking meeting on March 19.In its last quarterly meeting on Dec. 16, 2019, the central bank maintained its monetary policy for the 14th consecutive quarter, leaving the discount rate at 1.375 percent, rates on accommodations with collateral at 1.750 percent, and rates on accommodations without collateral at 3.625 percent.On Tuesday, the Fed made an emergency decision to cut its key interest rates by 0.50 percentage points, joining a growing list of central banks worldwide that have been easing their monetary policies to combat the economic risks posed by the COVID-19 outbreak.""In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate,"" the Fed said, announcing its first emergency action since December 2008 during the global financial crisis.Wang Jiann-chyuan (王健全), vice president of Taiwan's Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER), said the recent heavy losses on the U.S. equity markets reflected panic selling among investors, who are deeply concerned about the effects of the epidemic on the economy.Apparently, the Fed felt a sense of urgency to lower interest rates as a stimulus measure and to prevent weakening of the economic fundamentals amid the COVID-19 escalation, Wang said.In Taiwan, however, the market remains awash in liquidity, so there is no need for its central bank to take similar action, according to Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su (蘇見文).""Many enterprises in Taiwan are sitting on large amounts of funds,"" Su said. ""Taiwan's problem is that enterprises lack good investment opportunities.""In similar vein, Lo said lowering interest rates in Taiwan could prompt heavier investment in the local property market, which would lead to overheating.In Taiwan, fiscal stimulus would be a more effective response to the economic effects of the coronavirus, he said.""The government has already proposed a (NT$60 billion) stimulus package to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with the difficulties arising from the virus outbreak,"" Lo said.

03/4/2020,"Taipei, March 4 (CNA) Several organizations called for an amnesty for illegal migrant workers in Taiwan on Wednesday, saying that excluding them from the epidemic prevention system amid the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak represents a potentially dangerous oversight that undermine efforts to stop the spread of the virus.At a press conference in front of the Legislative Yuan, the Taiwan International Workers' Association (TIWA), amongst others, urged the government not to deport or fine undocumented workers in Taiwan, and to grant them legal status.Only through these measures can the gap in the epidemic prevention system be fixed, the organizations said.The groups were responding to concerns that the nearly 50,000 illegal migrant workers in Taiwan represent a serious loophole in the epidemic prevention system, after an undocumented Indonesian female caregiver was confirmed as Taiwan's 32nd COVID-19 patient.Following her diagnosis, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) sent an official document to New Taipei City government instructing the city to investigate the case, which some interpreted as a sign the government is cracking down on illegal workers.Although the MOL has said the document was simply an administrative procedure, not a crackdown, migrant rights groups have continued to call for an amnesty for undocumented workers so they can seek treatment without fear of deportation during the epidemic.Chen Hsiu-lien (陳秀蓮), a member of the TIWA, said at the Wednesday press conference that during an outbreak, everyone needs to be included in the epidemic prevention system, regardless of their legal status.Taiwan's policies towards undocumented migrant workers, which are limited to deportation, fines, and prohibiting them from being given legal status, Chen said, ensure that even if these individuals have symptoms of COVID-19, they would rather take their chances than seek treatment.The MOL and National Immigration Agency should immediately cancel punishments against illegal migrant workers so they can be included in epidemic prevention measures, Chen said.Huang Tzu-hua (黃姿華), a representative of a caregivers' union based in Taoyuan, said at the press conference that without a national health insurance (NHI) card, undocumented workers are unable to buy masks under the government rationing system, and are therefore already at higher risk of exposure to the virus.She urged the government to review its policies towards these workers and to grant them an opportunity to work legally.Other organizations at the press conference included the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, the Green Citizens' Action Alliance and the Global Workers' Organization, Taiwan.In response to the organizations' demands, the MOL said illegal migrant workers are in violation of the Employment Service Act and the Immigration Act, and if discovered, are deported and barred from working in Taiwan again.For an amnesty to be granted to undocumented migrant workers, the law would need to be amended, which requires a consensus in society, the ministry added.During the COVID-19 outbreak, the MOL will cooperate fully with the Central Epidemic Command Center in promoting epidemic prevention measures to migrant workers, and will continue to focus on encouraging illegal workers to turn themselves in instead of launching a crackdown, the ministry said.The MOL has posted information on COVID-19 in English, Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, and Indonesian on its website to prevent migrant workers from becoming a loophole in prevention efforts, it said.When asked about the issue Wednesday, Minister of the Interior Hsu Kuo-yung (徐國勇) said that the ministry will focus its efforts on encouraging illegal migrant workers to turn themselves in.As to whether such workers could be granted legal status, Hsu said ""the law is the law,"" and they will be dealt with accordingly.According to National Immigration Agency statistics, there are 48,545 undocumented migrant workers in Taiwan, with 290 in detention centers as of the end of January.(By Wang Cheng-chung, Wu Hsin-yun, Wu Jui-chi and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003040014

A total of 10 journalists also interviewed him.The CECC is working to identify people who might have come into contact with him during his stay in Taiwan.The concert hall will be closed for disinfection on Friday.According to EVA Air, its BR315 flight was scheduled to return to Taiwan Thursday night, but was canceled due to the news, with passengers forced to take other flights by other airlines.The plane that carried the passenger with the coronavirus was given additional deep cleaning and disinfection, the airline said.The aircraft is scheduled to fly back to Taiwan on Friday carrying only crew members, a source familiar with the matter said.Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, said that he hoped EVA Air crew members can get information and data of the confirmed patient from the Australian authorities, including where he was seated in the cabin of the flight.All crew members will be subject to self-health management and those who have come into contact with the patient will have to undergo mandatory quarantine or isolation.(By Chang Ming-hsuan, Yu Hsiao-han, Wang Shu-fen and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003050019

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As Taiwan's production of face masks is gradually starting to catch up with the massive demand due to panic over the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the ration limit was raised to three per adult and five per child on Thursday (March 5), but long lines were still a problem in some areas.

Nearly a month ago on Feb. 6, the Taiwan government launched a new rationing system for masks that was based on IDs and limited the quantity to two per person per week. As Taiwan ramped up manufacturing with the goal of becoming the second-largest surgical mask producer in the world, production rose to 8.2 million per day last week.

In order to diminish the crowds of people swarming around stores, those whose NHI cards end with odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are restricted to purchasing on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, while those whose cards end with even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) are limited to buying masks on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, with both allowed to make purchases on Sundays.

On Monday (March 2), the country's health authorities announced that a new ration of three masks per adult per week and five per child under the age of 13 would go into effect on Thursday. However, on the first day of the new system, there were still reports of tensions at drug stores as people jostled for their new quota of masks.

A user of the Taiwanese Facebook page Bao Yuan Commune (爆怨公社) on Thursday complained that as she was lining up to buy masks for her daughter, a middle-aged woman wearing a red shirt cut in front of her. Next, another middle-aged woman wearing a blue shirt approached the woman in red, began talking to her, and the two ultimately shared a spot in line.

When the netizen asked the woman in red to step to the back of the line, she snarled ""There's enough masks to go around."" The Facebook user then bitterly wrote, ""When a dama [big aunty] says these kinds of shameless things, you know there is no need to continue communicating. Is it really that hard to stand in line?""

Many netizens were angered by the account:

""She really has thick skin.""

""The next time this happens, shout 'someone cut in line!' Use a loud voice to make her lose face all the way back home.""

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) thanked U.K. politicians for voicing their support for Taiwan’s inclusion in the World Health Organization (WHO).

Led by Lord Rogan and Martin Vickers, co-chairs of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group, 55 British politicians signed a letter addressing WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the end of February — the second letter within a month. They expressed concerns over the United Nations health agency’s decision to include Taiwan under China in a reference to the risk of infection by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), according to MOFA on Wednesday (Mar. 4).

Taiwan is not under China’s jurisdiction, and Taiwan and China have separate healthcare systems independent from each other, said the letter. WHO’s decision to exclude the Taiwanese government and medical experts has dangerously weakened global efforts in combating infectious diseases, stated the letter.

The letter urged the health agency to correct its reference to Taiwan and allow Taiwan’s participation at WHO meetings and activities. Lord Rogan had previously sent a letter on Feb. 6 to the WHO director-general, urging him to allow Taiwan to take part in this year’s World Health Assembly and to correct the policy of including Taiwan as part of China, said MOFA.

Also in February, U.K. Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the United Nations Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon declared support for the island nation’s participation in such international organizations as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and WHO.

MOFA expressed gratitude to the U.K. parliament and administration for backing Taiwan’s participation in the international community.

The takeovers began about half a year before the Jan. 11 presidential and legislative elections, according to the MJIB, which added that the Chinese have established links between websites, Facebook groups, and “content farms” which spread official government propaganda or outright false information.

The websites form a channel through which China can infiltrate public opinion in Taiwan, inserting misleading reports to incite discussion and create confusion, CIA quoted the MJIB as saying.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3891712

03/8/2020,"Taipei, March 8 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Sunday said DNA testing showed that a Taiwanese woman was most likely infected with the COVID-19 virus while traveling in Egypt last month and not necessarily the source of infection for 12 workers on a Nile cruise.According to the CECC, the female patient, the 39th confirmed COVID-19 case in Taiwan, was traveling with a tour group to Dubai and Egypt from Jan. 29 to Feb. 21.The woman in her 60s who lives in northern Taiwan developed a soar throat and a cough while in Egypt on about Feb. 20. After returning to Taiwan, her symptoms continued to worsen and she was admitted to hospital on Feb. 28. Test results confirmed that she had the coronavirus on Feb. 29.She is currently undergoing medical treatment in an isolation room, CECC added.The CECC has previously said it suspected the woman was infected by the Egyptian tour guide in her tour group.However, Egyptian Health Ministry and World Health Organization officials recently identified the Taiwanese woman as the source of 12 COVID-19 patients, crew members on the Nile cruise ship she took during her Egypt trip.Speaking during a CECC press event Sunday, National Taiwan University (NTU) Department of Microbiology Professor Yeh Shiou-hwei (葉秀慧) said her team has sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of the coronavirus found in the female patient to determine the source of the virus.Yeh said doing a DNA sequencing test on a virus is like doing a ""paternity test"" to determine its source; by comparing its sequence with other coronavirus clades found around the globe.An analysis of genome sequencing of all the 45 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Taiwan shows basically four sub-clades of coronavirus.However, the DNA sequencing of the 39th patient indicates that the virus strain she was infected with has little similarity with the virus strains found in the other Taiwanese patients.It is closer to those found in coronavirus infection samples in Europe, including those in Italy, Brazil and Nigeria, according to Yeh.As such, the results indicate that the Taiwanese patient was not infected with the coronavirus in Taiwan but likely did so during her Egypt trip, which means she was not necessarily the source of the cluster infection among the Egyptian crew members.(By Chen Wei-ting and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003080011

03/9/2020,"Taipei, March 9 (CNA) The opposition Koumintang (KMT) saw 48-year-old Legislator Chiang Chi-chen (江啟臣) sworn in as its youngest chairman in several decades Monday, who pledged to promote a ""collective leadership"" to initiate interior reforms.The inauguration ceremony was held in the presence of several former chairmen, including Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), Wu Poh-hsiung (吳伯雄) and Wu Den-yih (吳敦義).""The KMT shall not wait for a certain wise leader to make policies any longer,"" said Chiang in an address at the event, but shall act to put together different people's wisdom and collect opinions from all parties involved.What the party needs now is dialogue and collaboration rather than conflict, he elaborated, and he will play the role of a chairman who is able to promote understanding and cooperation between different generations within the veteran party.With this in mind, he therefore has decided to push for a ""collective leadership"" to seek policies that cover as many possible aspects as possible.Chiang further stated that his role as party chairman is to ""listen, collect (different opinions) and turn people's expectations into visions.""For the so-called ""collective leadership,"" Chiang did not give any details in his speech. However, before he registered in early February to run in the March 7 chairman by-election, he proposed the creation of an 11-member ""decision-making platform"" to decide major issues, if elected.Members would include the newly elected chairman, the party's legislative caucus whip, the KMT secretary-general, local mayors and magistrates, as well as other party members and think tank researchers, Chiang said early this year.The platform should be able to react quickly to changes in public opinion and solve problems efficiently, he said, adding that its creation would ensure that more opinions are taken into account when making key decisions.A U.S.-educated politician, Chiang entered politics in 2010 when he was appointed minister of the now-defunct Government Information Office under the Executive Yuan.He won in Taichung in the national legislative elections in January, his third consecutive victory of its kind since 2012, receiving more votes than any other KMT legislative candidate in the 2020 elections.Chiang defeated former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin (郝龍斌), 69, by more than 46,000 votes in the chairman by-election to become the youngest chairman of the KMT since Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正) assumed the office as head of the party in 1926 when he was 39 years old.At that time, the position of the KMT leader was titled ""president,"" instead of ""chairman.""Former Chairman Wu Den-yih stepped down four days after the party's crushing defeat in the Jan. 11 presidential and legislative elections. Critics have blamed the loss on the party's aging leadership and membership structures and outdated cross-Taiwan Strait policy.At a post-presidential election workshop held Jan. 13 in Taipei, Kharis Templeman, adviser to the Project on Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, said the KMT needs younger candidates who can speak the language of people under 40 and its new party chairman needs to focus on a youth strategy.The KMT also needs to adjust its position on key issues related to relations with China, such as the so-called ""1992 consensus,"" due to its seeming detachment from reality, Templeman further said at that time.The consensus is a tacit understanding reached in 1992 between the then-KMT government and the Chinese government. It has been consistently interpreted by the KMT as both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledging that there is only ""one China"" with each side free to interpret what ""China"" means.However, Beijing has never publicly recognized the second part of the KMT interpretation.Since Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took office as president in May 2016, her rejection of the 1992 consensus has led to China suspending official cross-strait dialogue and stopping independent Chinese travelers from visiting Taiwan.Despite these drops in cross-strait interactions, Tsai won her second term in an overwhelming victory in the 2020 election, while her pro-independence DPP took the majority 61 seats in the 113-seat Legislature.(By Liu Kuan-ting and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003090009

""Such covers can prolong mask lifespan, but they have to be washed every day for hygiene purposes,"" she said.Medical experts have suggested that mask cover users wash their covers every day, and discard the wrapped surgical masks every two to three days, particularly when the weather is hot.Also, people are advised to wear surgical masks without the covers during visits to hospitals or places where the risk of virus transmission is high, such as crowded and confined spaces.Hospitals frequently remind visitors to discard their masks right after leaving, given the risk that the virus could spread through airborne droplets that have landed on used masks.Taiwan Adventist Hospital physician Su Chih-sheng (蘇志盛) said mask covers are a ""nice"" alternative for mass transportation commuters or people who may stay in confined spaces for short periods of time, but definitely not for medical and quarantine personnel.(By Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003110012

Furthermore, Fukushima's agricultural exports are now 1.4 times more than in the period before the disaster, Izumi said.In addition, tourist arrivals in the six prefectures in the region last year were about three times more that before the earthquake, he said.Earlier Wednesday, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) tweeted in Japanese that at 2:46 p.m. (Japan time), she will pray with her Japanese friends for those who perished in the disaster. ""Taiwan and Japan are friends,"" she headed the tweet.Taiwan's representative office in Japan later posted Tsai's tweet on its Facebook page with a photo showing a paper crane made by Izumi and the words ""Thank you Taiwan, Taiwan and Japan go go go"" in his calligraphy.(By Chen Yun-yu, Flor Wang and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003110023

When selling set in later, at one point the index plummeted by more than 500 points due to a loss of investor confidence.During the session, nearly 60 stocks fell by the daily maximum cap of 10 percent, triggering heavy selling pressure, especially on high-tech shares -- the mainstay of the domestic bourse.Heavyweight electronics shares, such as Largan Precision Co., Taiwan Semicondcutor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., all suffered heavy losses.Largan, the most expensive stock on the Taiwan stock market and a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., finished 9.24 percent lower to end at NT$3,980.Largan has lost NT$160 million in market value over the past two months, with shares falling 23 percent from their peak of NT$5,210.Due to the spread of the coronavirus that saw some clients in China not re-start operations until after the Lunar New Year holiday, Largan's consolidated revenue in February registered a month-on-month fall of 11 percent and an annual increase of 45 percent to NT$3.673 billion.Hon Hai, the world's largest contract home appliance maker and a major assembler of Apple Inc.'s iPhones, lost 4.96 percent ending the day at NT$74.7, while TSMC, the world's No. 1 contract chipmaker, fell 2.65 percent at NT$294.At a recent online investor conference, Hon Hai said its plants in China have largely resumed business, and the group expects to fully resume normal operations by the end of March.With the COVID-19 crisis rapidly worsening in the U.S. and Europe, global stock markets have been overcome by a growing panic. As a result, the domestic market may continue to sink in the short-term, testing the 10,000-point mark, analysts said.Amid weak investor confidence, the weighted index has dropped by more than 900 points this week, suggesting that even a technical rebound in the short-term will not help recover the losses until there are signs of the pandemic easing, they said.As the short term outlook for Taiwan's market remains pessimistic due to the turmoil on global markets, in particular the U.S. market, it is very likely the domestic market will see its weighted index fall below the 10,000-point mark soon, they forecast.Meanwhile, Frank Juan (阮清華), deputy minister of finance and executive secretary of the National Stabilization Fund, tried to calm investors, saying the fundamentals of the local bourse remain healthy and the authorities are keeping a close eye on developments.He added that the state-owned National Stabilization Fund will enter the market if necessary to prevent excessive market instability.(By Flor Wang, Chung Jung-feng and Han Ting-ting) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003120011
03/12/2020,"Taipei, March 12 (CNA) Over 88,000 people were able to pre-order their weekly ration of surgical face masks online as of Thursday afternoon after a new mask-purchasing system went online earlier in the day, although the system temporarily crashed due to overload, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, said that as of 2 p.m., 88,000 people had placed orders via either the government website https://emask.taiwan.gov.tw/msk/index.jsp, or via a National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) mobile app.Chen said many users complained about being unable to link to the system after it first went online on 9 a.m., but the situation was quickly resolved.To use the online ordering system, consumers either need to have access to a card reader or need to download the NHIA app.After logging onto the website, consumers with a card reader linked to their computers will be required to insert either their National Health Insurance (NHI) or Citizen Digital Certificate card to place their order for three masks, the maximum allowable per purchase.According to Cabinet spokeswoman Kolas Yotaka, those who use their Citizen Digital Certificate cards to make their orders said the system went smoothly for them, but those who purchased with their NHI cards, either through the website or via the mobile app, complained about being unable to access the system.According to the NHIA, more than 87,250 people logged on to the mobile app when it first went online at 9 a.m., causing an overload.Kolas said the government is now expanding the bandwidth of the NHIA's Internet system to accommodate the high demand.She called on people who wish to make online purchases to take their time because the trial run for the system will run for a whole week and people can use it at any time from March 12 to March 18.The CECC previously estimated that some 2.33 million people will take advantage of the online sales during the one-week trial period, buying a total of 7 million masks.If the number of buyers exceeds the estimated 2.33 million masks during the trial period, the CECC said, the government will introduce a weekly lottery system to determine who can purchase masks online.Meanwhile, Deputy Health Minister Ho Chi-kung (何啟功) said that so far, foreign nationals who do not have NHI cards will not be able to buy their three-masks-per-week rations online, since the purchase requires verification of their NHI number.He also said the government will consider building the online mask-purchase website and app in both Chinese and English.Foreign nationals who do not have NHI cards can still buy their rationed masks by showing their Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or entry permit at local drugstores as they did before, according to the ministry.According to the CECC, masks purchased via the website or the NHIA app can be paid for with a credit card, at an ATM or via online banking, adding that the details for making payments will be issued to the buyers March 19 upon completion of the online or mobile transaction.The cost of the masks will remain at NT$5 (US$0.16) each, but online purchases will have a shipping fee of NT$7 per order, which means each transaction will total NT$22, according to the CECC.During the pickup period March 26-April 1 at designated convenience stores, buyers will have to show their NHI cards or proof of purchase, it added.Due to high demand amid the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic, the government has been requisitioning all masks produced in the country and rationing them after supplying hospitals and healthcare workers.Under the rationing system that began Feb. 6, anyone can buy disposable surgical masks on Sundays at designated drugstores and pharmacies upon presentation of their NHI cards, while on the other days of the week, sales are staggered based on the last digit of the ID number on the buyer's NHI card.However, because of the limited supply and the sales times set by the pharmacies, people have been complaining about the time it takes to wait in line to buy the masks, with office workers in particular having said it is a problem for them.With the introduction of the new online system, which is based on the existing online taxpaying system, the government is offering an alternative and will make any necessary adjustments after the one-week trial period, according to the health minister.(By Ku Chuan, Chang Ming-hsuan and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003120008

03/13/2020,"Taipei, March 13 (CNA) A coalition of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that fight for the rights of migrant workers initiated a petition Friday to urge the government not to detain or deport undocumented migrant workers who seek medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.Gracie Liu (劉曉櫻), director of the Migrants and Immigrants Service Center under the Hsinchu Catholic Diocese, told CNA that the online petition calls for the government not to arrest the undocumented migrant workers because otherwise they could be reluctant to seek treatment for fear of being deported.""The idea is to let them seek medical treatment or consultation and be able to freely leave hospitals and clinics without fear of arrest,"" Liu said.Concerns of a crackdown were raised Feb. 28, when the Ministry of Labor's Workforce Development Agency Deputy Director-General Tsai Meng-liang (蔡孟良) said that a search system worked out in collaboration with the National Immigration Agency (NIA) will soon open to track down undocumented migrant workers in Taiwan.Tsai made the statement after an undocumented female caregiver from Indonesia was confirmed Feb. 26 as the 32nd patient in Taiwan to contract COVID-19. Taiwan currently has 50 confirmed cases of the acute respiratory disease, caused by a new coronavirus, since it emerged from China at the end of last year.The petition also urges the government to abolish penalties and re-entry bans for undocumented migrant workers who wish to return to their country of origin during the pandemic, Liu said.Under current regulations, if an undocumented worker is arrested and deported, then they lose their right to ever work again in Taiwan.In response, Paul Su (蘇裕國), deputy director of the Cross-Border Workforce Management Division under the Labor Ministry's Workforce Development Agency, said that his ministry for the time being will not coordinate any large-scale crackdown on undocumented workers.""However, the abolition of fines, re-entry bans and restoration of documented status needs revision of the current laws, which require consensus in society,"" he said.If a member of the general public makes a report on an undocumented migrant worker, the MOL will still dispatch the local government to investigate, although deportation will be up to the NIA.There were an estimated 48,545 undocumented migrant workers in Taiwan as of the end of January, with 290 in detention centers, according to NIA statistics.The petition was initiated by around a dozen migrant worker organizations, scholars and experts, including the Taiwan International Workers' Association, the Domestic Caretakers Union Taoyuan, Serve the People Association, Taoyuan; Hope Workers' Center and the Hsinchu Migrants and Immigrants Service Center.(By William Yen) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003130019

His diagnosis was confirmed on Saturday, and he is also being treated in a negative-pressure isolation room in hospital, the CECC said.So far, the CECC said, it has identified 15 people who came in contact with the 53rd patient, and is still tracing his movements in the period after he returned to Taiwan.The CECC thinks that all three cases were imported, based on the patients' travel history and when they began to show symptoms, Chen said.Meanwhile, the CEEC now requires all passengers arriving from 27 European countries, including the United Kingdom, to remain in home quarantine for 14 days, in light of the escalation of the outbreak in Europe, he said.At a press conference last week, Chen said Europe was likely to be hit by a ""second wave"" of COVID-19 cases, with the number soon surpassing those in Asia.(By Wu Hsin-yun, Chang Ming-hsuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003140009

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Haiti expelled the Taiwanese ambassador over “a small incident” but is nevertheless planning to maintain diplomatic relations, Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste reported Thursday (March 12).

The French-speaking Caribbean nation is one of 15 remaining diplomatic allies following relentless Chinese efforts to restrict Taiwan’s international space. The new agency quoted the country’s foreign minister, Claude Joseph, as saying that it was awaiting the replacement of Taiwanese Ambassador Bernard Bang-zyh Liu (劉邦治).

The minister was quoted as saying the incident was “a matter of national sovereignty” and ""had been rapidly resolved.” The incident reportedly occurred in early January at the private residence of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse.

According to UDN, Liu and Moïse had a quarrel, after which Haiti demanded the diplomat leave the country within 72 hours. The appointment of a new ambassador was also demanded, and Taiwan’s interests have since then been managed by a chargé d'affaires.

Joseph emphasized the relationship between the two countries remains “intact” despite the incident. “There is an interesting, cordial relationship between Haiti and Taiwan,” he told Le Nouvelliste.

In Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Liu returned home on official business and that communication between the two governments was normal, with joint projects proceeding as planned. Liu served in Haiti from 2010 to 2014 and again since late last year.

Le Nouvelliste noted that the ambassador had been working on several projects, especially in the field of agricultural cooperation. A decision on a US$150 million (NT$4.5 billion) Taiwan loan for investment in Haiti’s electricity sector had not been reached after the Caribbean country’s parliament suspended operations in January amid political unrest.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3897143

03/16/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Sunday (March 15) that the Pacific nation is closely following Taiwan as a model in its battle against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

In an interview with the talk radio network Newstalk ZB, Ardern said that the country's officials are banning public gatherings of 500 people or more, including musical festivals and events that are expected to attract large crowds. She pointed out that the New Zealand government has been looking to different countries to gain a better grasp on containing the virus, reported Storm Media.

Ardern said the government has been following Taiwan in advising cancellation of educational institutions and crowded gatherings, which is why schools in New Zealand have not yet been suspended. She called the Taiwanese model ""quite successful"" and praised the island country for creating an effective framework for mass gatherings.

The prime minister emphasized that social distancing has to become the ""new normal"" and that New Zealanders need to comply with government policies closely to ensure the nation's safety. She noted that there will be ""zero tolerance"" for foreign tourists who defy the 14-day quarantine requirement after arriving in New Zealand.

03/19/2020,"Taipei, March 19 (CNA) President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) said Thursday that the next 14 days will be critical to Taiwan's COVID-19 prevention efforts, and called on the public to take three steps to assist the government's response, after a one-week period in which Taiwan's confirmed cases have more than doubled to 108.Speaking at the Presidential Office Building, Tsai said that since confirming its first COVID-19 case two months ago, Taiwan has effectively mobilized to prevent the virus' spread during the first wave of cases from abroad.However, with the global spread of the virus in recent weeks, ""the next 14 days will be a critical second stage in the epidemic response effort, and we will need everyone to strengthen their resolve to meet this challenge,"" she said.To assist the government's response, Tsai made three appeals to the public, starting with a call to follow the Central Epidemic Command Center's (CECC) epidemic prevention guidelines, despite their inconvenience in the short-term.Second, she urged people not to blame others for the outbreak, but instead be grateful for the sacrifices being made by medical personnel, manufacturers of protective supplies, and those complying with home quarantine and self-health management guidelines.Tsai further asked that people refrain from creating panic and assist the government in transmitting accurate information about the virus.In an apparent response to reports of panic-buying at supermarkets following the government's announcement Wednesday of 23 new COVID-19 cases and tighter border controls, Tsai pledged that supplies of consumer goods would remain stable, but warned that ""if people are found hoarding supplies or manipulating prices, they will face heavy fines.""Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) repeated Tsai's call for calm during the CECC's daily press briefing Thursday, pointing out that Taiwan has had relatively few indigenous cases of the virus, and has a prevalence rate tens of times lower than many other countries.There will only be shortages if people engage in panic-buying, he said.Assessing the overall state of Taiwan's response, Chen said the main focus is ensuring the virus does not spread at a community level.Referring to the four signs that characterize community transmission of the virus, Chen said Taiwan does not meet the condition of ""indigenous cases outnumbering imported cases,"" but said the situation still requires a high degree of vigilance.The other three signs of community transmission are cases that cannot be traced to anyone known to have an infection, evidence of a continuous chain of infection, and a large number of cluster cases of the virus.(By Yeh Su-ping, Wen Kuei-hsiang and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003190021
03/19/2020,"Taipei, March 19 (CNA) In concert with actions taken by central banks around the world to stimulate the economy, Taiwan's central bank decided to cut its key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points after concluding a quarterly policymaking meeting Thursday.The move marked the first rate cut by the local central bank after leaving interest rates unchanged for 14 consecutive quarters, at a time when the global economy faces strong headwinds caused by the coronavirus disease COVID-19.After the rate cut comes into force Friday, the central bank's discount rate will fall to 1.125 percent, the lowest in the country's history.The previous lowest discount rate was 1.25 percent during the 2009 global financial crisis.In addition, the rate on accommodations with collateral will drop to 1.50 percent and the rate on accommodations without collateral will decline to 3.375 percent, according to the central bank.Market analysts said the central bank faced pressure to ease monetary policy, in particular after the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rates 1 percentage point to zero on Sunday to combat the economic impact of COVID-19.It was the second emergency rate cut by the Fed in just 15 days after an earlier reduction of 0.50 percentage points on March 3.In addition to a cut in its key interest rates, the Fed also announced a new round of quantitative easing by injecting US$700 billion into the market.Commenting on the rate cuts by central banks around the world, Wu Meng-tao (吳孟道), director of the sixth research division of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER), said fears over the virus contagion has sent ripples through global equity markets and are expected to create systematic risks to the economy.The rate reductions aim to avoid a credit crunch in the business sector, and prevent business closures, which could shore up public confidence in the economy, Wu said.Meanwhile, taking into account uncertainty created by the spread of COVID-19, the central bank also cut its forecast for growth in Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 from 2.57 percent, made in early March, to 1.92 percent.The central bank was more downbeat about the local economy with its prediction that GDP growth for 2020 will be under 2 percent.In a hearing held at the Legislative Yuan Wednesday, Chu Tzer-ming (朱澤民), head of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), told lawmakers that the local economy is expected to grow by at least 2 percent in 2020 on the back of the government's NT$100 billion (US$3.28 billion) stimulus efforts, including a special NT$60 billion budget.In February, the DGBAS said it expected Taiwan's GDP to grow 2.37 percent in 2020, a downgrade from a forecast of 2.72 percent made in November, citing the spread of the virus.The DGBAS could cut its forecast again in May.(By Pan Tzu-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003190018

(TSMC) has been infected with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has resulted in home quarantining of 30 others who had close contact with the patient, the company reported Wednesday.In a statement filed with the Taiwan Stock Exchange, TSMC said the development would have no significant impact on its operations.However, the company said, it has put in place a system that would allow its employees to work in small groups in segregated spaces to reduce the risk of contagion. In addition, the routine disinfection efforts at the company will be stepped up in both the work areas and public spaces, TSMC said.It said the employee who tested positive for COVID-19 is in hospital and will be receiving any necessary counselling and assistance, which will be provided by the company.Regarding the 30 employees in quarantine for 14 days, TSMC said it will closely monitor their health and offer them assistance.Meanwhile, all employees at the company have been asked to wear surgical masks in meetings and training sessions and when they go out in public, the company said.TSMC is headquartered in the Hsinchu Science Park and has plants in the other major science parks in Hsinchu, Taichung and Kaohsiung.The company did not name the location at which the infected employee was working, but deputy head of the Hsinchu Science Park Bureau Hsu Tseng-ju (許增如) said all companies there have been asked to increase their efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.For example, he said, manufacturers in the park have been asked to communicate with their clients abroad via video conferencing instead of holding face to face meetings.Companies in the park have also been advised to put in place contingency plans for offsite work in the event of a major COVID-19 outbreak there, Hsu said.On Thursday, TSMC shares dropped 3.69 percent to close at NT$248.00 (US$8.15), while the benchmark weighted index ended down 5.83 percent at 8,681.34 points.The stock went ex-dividend Thursday to give NT$2.5 in cash dividend per share on its earnings for the third quarter of last year, and failed to return to its previous share price level amid rising concerns over the spread of COVID-19.Ex-dividend is when a stock begins trading without the dividend value, which means that on Thursday, TSMC shares began trading at NT$2.5 less than their closing price of NT$260.00 on Wednesday.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003190009

The cluster has seen 14 people infected, Chen noted.As for the remaining three cases (two women and one man), their infections originated in Taiwan, with one having an unknown source and having not traveled abroad in the past several months, Chen said.The woman, in her 30s, fell ill on March 17 and tested positive on Friday for the coronavirus, Chen said, noting an investigation has been launched on the patient's family and her workplace to ascertain the source of infection.One of the other two indigenous cases is a classmate of the senior high school student who was confirmed as the country's 59th case on March 15 and whose infection became apparent after returning from a trip to Greece, according to Chen.The teenage girl was the second classmate of the 59th case to be infected, Chen said, adding that from Friday, their school was closed until March 29.The third case is a man in his 30s, who said he had not traveled abroad recently but began to show symptoms on March 17, one day before he visited a doctor and took a COVID-19 test, the result of which came back positive on Friday.According to Chen, the man reported that he had contact on March 12 and 13 with a supervisor who had just returned from the United States and who developed symptoms suspected of being COVID-19 infection on March 14.In addition, his two foreign colleagues at the same office also showed ""suspected symptoms"" on March 17 and 18, respectively, Chen said.(By Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003200013
03/20/2020,"Taipei, March 20 (CNA) As the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic continues to strike hard around the world, local tourism-related businesses are unlikely to see a V-shaped rebound any time soon, Taiwan's central bank said Friday.Despite the fact that the effects of delayed purchases after the pandemic can be expected, the impact on the global and domestic economies of COVID-19 is far greater than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, the bank said in a report.Tourism-related sectors, in particular, will be hardest-hit, with widespread travel restrictions and bans on mass gatherings imposed by governments across the world, it said.""It is difficult to say that there will be a V-shaped rebound at the moment, as all depends on the development of the pandemic,"" it said.Taking the SARS that broke out in late 2002 as an example, the bank said the domestic economy rapidly lost momentum in the second quarter of 2003 after the disease took its toll on global activity.Over the three-month period, travel volume on international flights to and from Taiwan plunged by 69.5 percent and Taiwan's economic growth for 2003 contracted by 1.15 percent as a result of the knock-on effects of SARS, the bank said.According to the report, passenger load factors on routes between Taiwan and China and those between Taiwan and Hong Kong and Taiwan and Macau in February plummeted by 90.9 percent and 94.4 percent, respectively, compared with their December levels.At the same time, taxi drivers saw a 30 percent drop in customer numbers, while tour bus operators also experienced a 17.2 percent decline in daily operations from January, the report said.In a similar vein, domestic economic expansion is likely to shrink this year, which the bank said had pushed it to cut its forecast for Taiwan's growth in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 from 2.57 percent made in March to 1.92 percent.In terms of related businesses, the restaurant/beverage sector typically enjoys the highest GDP ratio yielded by the tourism industry, while tourism agencies, hotels, car rental and air transportation companies also glean a noticeable portion of their incomes from it, it said.(By Flor Wang and Pan Tzu-yu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003200010

03/20/2020,"Taipei, March 20 (CNA) Taiwan started a three-month amnesty program for foreign nationals who have overstayed their visas, allowing them to pay smaller fines should they decide to report to the immigration authorities during the grace period, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said Friday.At a press conference, NIA Deputy Director-General Bill Chung (鐘景琨) said that the ""Expanded Overstayers Voluntary Departure Program,"" which will run until June 30, comes at a time during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which undocumented migrant workers and general visa overstayers may wish to go back to their countries of origin but are concerned about the penalties they might incur.Under the program, there will be no mandatory detention, while the maximum penalty will be NT$2,000 (US$66) and no re-entry ban, compared with detention, a maximum fine of NT$10,000 and an entry ban of 1 to 8 years for those who do not voluntarily contact immigration authorities, Chung said.""In other words, we won't detain or restrict them from returning to Taiwan at a later date, while minimizing the fine to only NT$2,000, which is the minimum fine if an overstayer is caught,"" he said.He encouraged all overstayers to use the program because the NIA plans to impose heavier penalties after the grace period and to organize a nationwide crackdown after the coronavirus pandemic period subsides, Chung said.The program officially starts on April 1, but amnesty privileges will also be available to those who turn themselves in from Friday, Chung said.According to NIA statistics, one of the largest number of overstaying foreign nationals in Taiwan are migrant workers, who accounted for 48,545 as of the end of January. Of that number, 23,474 were Indonesian, 21,931 were Vietnamese, 2,366 were Filipino, 773 were from Thailand and one from Malaysia.Teddy Surachmat, deputy head of the Indonesian representative office in Taiwan, told CNA that his office will distribute information about the amnesty through online media, and will also utilize the help of other Indonesian migrant workers and community leaders to get the word out to undocumented migrant workers.Surachmat also asked the Taiwan government to test undocumented Indonesian migrant workers who voluntarily contact the immigration authorities for COVID-19 before repatriating them.In response, Chung said that his agency will follow the guidelines set by the Central Epidemic Command Center by measuring temperatures and examining any overstayer to evaluate if there is a need to send such a person for further testing by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control.The program follows on from a similar program conducted from January until the end of June last year, in which over 17,000 overstayers, including more than 9,000 previously undocumented migrant workers who voluntarily contacted immigration authorities were repatriated.An undocumented migrant worker, who wished to remain anonymous, said the amnesty was ""good news,"" but said she will stay and work in Taiwan because she has a family she needs to support.""I will just avoid going out if it's not necessary and take extra care of myself,"" she said.However, she said she is still willing to seek medical help if she develops symptoms that resembles the coronavirus.(By William Yen) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003200006

(TIAC).Construction of the main building is scheduled to be completed in 2025, with its northern and southern concourses finished in 2024 and 2026, respectively, according to TIAC.That represents a significant delay for the project which started in 2017 and was initially scheduled to be operational by 2021, after several unsuccessful tenders due to low interest from local building contractors.For example, the main building was originally budgeted for NT$22 billion, though that was raised to NT$39.6 billion in 2018 and NT$44.8 billion in 2019 after two and one unsuccessful tenders, respectively.The project was widely criticized for a complicated design by the British architectural firm Rogers Stirk Harbour+ Partners and poor budget management.To fix the problems, TIAC said, it reviewed the project with the designers and decided to remove a huge skylight but keep the featured wavy ceilings and petal-shaped aluminum installations in the terminal.TIAC Senior Vice President Fan Hsiao-lun (范孝倫) said the company will cut costs by introducing more migrant workers, under the Executive Yuan's loosening of related regulations.The company said it will also provide more incentives for contractors, such as utility subsidies and reduction of security deposits, and ask for cross-ministry collaboration to help reduce risks during construction.The new budget will be sent to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications for review, before being submitted to the Executive Yuan for final approval, the company said.Last year, passenger volume at the airport reached 49 million, far exceeding the 35 million passengers the two existing terminals were designed to handle.(By Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003200018

If we didn't catch anything, we just have to keep working, even for 34 hours straight. If it were possible, I'd like to change how much time we have to work and rest, to meet the needs of human bodies. There's got to be a way to make it more balanced, just like how people who work on land do it,"" an anonymous fisherman was cited as saying in the report.In addition to poor labor conditions, Greenpeace said, it identified two Taiwanese fishing boats it suspected of shark finning and illegal transshipments, adding that both are business partners of Fong Chun Formosa (FCF), which recently acquired U.S. seafood company Bumble Bee.The group called on FCF, one of the world's top three tuna traders with strong market links in Japan, the Americas and Europe, to take more proactive action, including enhancing the traceability of the seafood supply chain, and strictly upholding international standards on human rights and labor rights.Greenpeace said it submitted the report to Taiwan's Fisheries Agency two weeks ago, and urged it to conduct an investigation.In response, Fisheries Agency Director-General Chang Chih-sheng (張致盛) said it needs time to verify the evidence provided by Greenpeace.Fisheries Agency officials said as Greenpeace did not provide the names of the interviewees or their work history on the vessels accused of engaging in forced labor, for instance, it will have to conduct its own thorough investigation and interview all fishermen on those vessels.The agency stressed that it has handled three forced labor cases over the past few years, and will not tolerate such practices if the accusations are proved to be true.(By Yang Shu-min and Lee Hsin-Yin) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003200009

03/21/2020,"Taipei, March 21 (CNA) Apple has announced it is limiting online purchases of select iPhone models in Taiwan and in other markets, amid disruptions to its supply chain.On its website in Taiwan, Apple said Friday that consumers will be limited to online purchases of no more than two of any of its latest iPhone models -- the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max -- that were launched last September.Customers can also buy no more than two of any of its earlier iPhone models -- the iPhone XR, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus -- per online purchase.The purchase limit for the new iPad Pro, which was unveiled on Wednesday, has also been set at two, while no more than five of the latest MacBook Air and the Mac mini can be bought at a time.International news media reported the purchase limits have also been applied in several other markets such as the United States, China, Hong Kong and Singapore.No purchase limits were set for the Apple Watch and earlier iPad models.The last time Apple put limits on purchases was in 2007, when the iPhone was introduced for the first time, to prevent people from reselling them.Analysts said the quotas were triggered by a fall in shipments from Apple's suppliers with production facilities in China after authorities there imposed lockdowns in a number of cities to contain the new coronavirus epidemic, disrupting production.There are also fears that the growing intensity of the epidemic in Europe and the United States could lead Apple to postpone the launch of the next generation of iPhones, a U.S. brokerage has said in a research note.Apple usually unveils its new iPhones in September and puts them on sale soon after the launch.As a result, the brokerage lowered its growth forecast for iPhone shipments in 2020 to 3 percent from 7 percent previously, and cut its target prices on shares of three Taiwanese iPhone assemblers -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp.The target price for Hon Hai shares has been cut to NT$95 (US$3.14) from NT$105, from NT$72 to NT$62 for Pegatron shares and from NT$26 to NT$18 for Wistron shares, the brokerage said.On Friday, Hon Hai closed up 6.79 percent to end at NT$70.80, Pegatron ended up 7.63 percent at NT$51.80, and Wistron closed up 9.38 percent at NT$20.40 as the Taiwan Stock Exchange staged a strong rebound.The market was boosted after the National Stabilization Fund was authorized a day earlier to step in to shore up the market amid global volatility.(By Jeffrey Wu and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003210012

""We are a uniquely resilient nation. I am confident that Italy will overcome even this challenge.""The Italian representative wanted to counter a perception in Taiwan's media that Italy is a ""vector"" of contagion, saying that his country is in fact a victim.""Characterizing Italy and the Italians as vectors of the contagion is untrue and insensitive. This emergency is not of Italy's making,"" he said. ""COVID-19 landed at Italy's doorstep as it has at Taiwan's and both sides have been doing their best to deal with the situation.""Another misconception, he said, is possible skepticism over the safety of Italian products, which, he stressed, cannot serve as a possible vehicle of contagion.On a broader scale, while acknowledging that people-to-people mobility in Italy and Taiwan has been affected by the outbreak since January, Giglio said ""it is unreasonable to make unnecessary obstacles to the displacement of goods and to the regular development of bilateral trade.""His comments came after the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) announced on Feb. 19 that Taiwan would prohibit imports of live pigs and pork products from Italy, effective the next day.The move followed an assessment of a growing African swine fever (ASF) epidemic seen in Sardinia.During the interview, Giglio said he was appealing to Taiwan's government to reconsider some recent unilateral decisions that have negatively affected the export of Italian products to Taiwan, particularly in the food sector.Touching on the topic of his office's recent campaign dubbed ""Italy-Taiwan: Healthy Together,"" the Italian representative said the activity is focused on promoting bilateral exchanges of know-how and experiences in the health sector, citing the ongoing university exchanges between Italian and Taiwanese medical teams as an example.""The COVID-19 emergency is a global challenge.

03/21/2020,"Editor's note: For readers' reference, Focus Taiwan compiled useful information of COVID-19 prevention and measures Taiwan has taken to stem outbreakAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the coronavirus disease that originated in Wuhan, China, is caused by a new strain of coronavirus that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease it causes is called COVID-19.Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.Most patients will recover, but some with a history of diseases, such as diabetes, chronic liver and kidney diseases and cardiovascular disease, may die, according to information from China‘s public health departments.The WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11.The WHO Recommends: *Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of the infection include washing hands regularly, covering one’s mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Recommends:*Wash your hands thoroughly with soap*Wear surgical masks when coughing or sneezing*Avoid crowded places, including hospitals*Avoid unnecessary overseas travel Attention: Wearing a surgical mask is a must when:  Visiting medical treatment facilities; presenting symptoms of fever or respiratory problems; having chronic diseases; or being in a confined space where contact with people is unavoidable, such as in an airplane.Washing hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is often more important than wearing masks because the new coronavirus can survive on the surface of objects for as long as five days during droplet transmission, meaning that keeping one’s hands clean is a must.The following are images taken from CDC's official website about how to wash hands properly in Indonesian, Thai and Vietnamese: @ Malay Version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=QoDuUzBEpvc&feature=emb_logo@Burmese Version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=tZZ1OJoSxec&feature=emb_logo Public health experts, meanwhile, advise people to keep a distance of at least 1 meter awayDisinfect the surface of objects people touch often with diluted bleach (1 portion bleach to 100 portion water) or 75% alcoholTo get help if you develop a fever and a cough after returning from COVID-19-circulating countries and areas within 14 days, or have contact with a COVID-19 patient within the period, please call the 1922 hotline.Migrant workers can call the 1955 hotline set up by the Ministry of Labor for relevant information and assistance in Chinese, English, Thai, Indonesian and Vietnamese.Wear surgical masks if you have a fever or other respiratory symptoms, and contact local health authorities by calling the hotlines for assistance. Inform doctors of travel history and possible exposure to the virus, such as for example, being in places where others had symptoms.Since Feb. 6, Taiwan has rationed the sale of face masks. At present, people can buy 3 masks for adults or 5 masks for children every 7 days for NT$5 per mask at designated drugstores and pharmacies by presenting their national health insurance (NHI) card.While sales are open to everyone on Sunday, they are limited based on the last digit of the ID number on the buyer's NHI card on other days of the week – those with odd ID numbers can buy masks on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and those with even numbers can buy masks on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.This restriction only applies to sales of adult masks. Children’s masks can be purchased any day of the week, but purchases are still limited to five masks every seven days. Starting April 9, residents will have access to 9 masks for adults every 14 days, up from three per week at present, while the quota for children's masks will remain at 10 every two weeks.Also, consumers will be able to buy all nine adult masks or all 10 children's masks in one purchase on any day of the week so that they won't have to line up for the masks once a week on specific days depending on whether a person's ID number on their NHI card is odd or even.Moreover, starting April 9, people can send up to 30 masks every two months by mail to their first- or second-degree relatives living in foreign countries.Foreign nationals in Taiwan will not be allowed to do this, however, because the government has no way of confirming who their relatives within a second-degree are. The only exception would be if the relative was a Taiwan national. A government-built masks supply platform at https://mask.pdis.nat.gov.tw/ allows people to search for close-by pharmacies for mask purchases. However, the information is currently only in Chinese.Link to real-time mask map https://mask.goodideas-studio.com/In mid-March, an online system for mask purchases (still limiting purchases to three masks per person every seven days) was launched on a trial basis. Orders can be placed via the government website https://emask.taiwan.gov.tw/msk/index.jsp, or through a National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) mobile app called 健保快易通 in Chinese.To use the online ordering system, consumers either must have access to a card reader or need to download the NHIA app.After logging onto the website, consumers with a card reader linked to their computers will be required to insert either their National Health Insurance (NHI) or Citizen Digital Certificate card to place their order for three masks, the maximum purchase. Each mask is still sold for NT$5 online, but a NT$7 transportation fee will be added to each order.Masks are also being sold at duty-free stores in five airports around Taiwan. Three adult masks or five children's masks are available for NT$50 or US$2. The sale still counts toward Taiwan's mask rationing system, which allows all residents to buy three masks every seven days.News about the new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is being circulated everywhere. While there is plenty of useful and reliable information online, there is also a lot of misinformation.False information includes an online message that encourages people to hoard food and basic household items -- toilet paper the preferred item -- after Taiwan surpassed 100 cases of the new coronavirus March 18.No supply shortage of toilet paper in Taiwan, the government declares. Actions have been taken to crack down on the spread of misinformation on the Internet.The following are a number of false and misleading posts on social media that Robert H. Shmerling, faculty editor of Harvard Health Publishing, singled out in his article, titled “Be careful where you get your news about coronavirus,” on the website https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/be-careful-where-you-get-your-news-about-coronavirus-2020020118801@“Oregano Oil Proves Effective Against Coronavirus,” an unfounded claim@ a hoax stating that the U.S. government had created and patented a vaccine for coronavirus years ago, shared with nearly 5,000 Facebook users@ a false claim that “coronavirus is a human-made virus in the laboratory”@ sales of unproven “nonmedical immune boosters” to help people ward off 2019-nCoV@ unfounded recommendations to prevent infection by taking vitamin C and avoiding spicy foods@ dangerous suggestions that drinking bleach and snorting cocaine can cure coronavirus infection@ a video with useless advice about preventing infection with the new coronavirus by modifying your diet (for example, by avoiding cold drinks, milkshakes, or ice cream). This video, which demonstrates the removal of a parasitic worm from a person’s lip, is many years old and has nothing to do with the current virus.Starting March 19, Taiwan implemented a ban on the entry of most foreign nationals.The only foreign nationals allowed entry are those who hold Alien Resident Certificates (ARCs), or documents proving they are in Taiwan for diplomatic or other official purposes, or to fulfill business contracts, as well as those who have received special permits.All arrivals from overseas — whether they are Taiwanese or foreign nationals — are subject to home quarantine for 14 days. Compensation of NT$1,000 per day will be offered to those who take the initiative to report their travel history. Meanwhile, a three-month amnesty program, TO BE EXPIRED ON JUNE 30, is available for foreign nationals who have overstayed their visas, allowing them to pay smaller fines should they decide to report to the immigration authorities during the grace period.Taiwan imposed highest travel warning on all overseas destinations on March 20, discouraging all non-essential travel to foreign countries.In Taipei, New Taipei and Keelung, ""quarantine hotels"" are open to individuals who are required to undergo quarantine but do not have a place to stay in Taiwan or do not want to stay in their own homes.

So far, 81 doctors, nurses and residents at the nursing home have been tested for COVID-19, and all have tested negative, according to Chen.Health authorities are now moving five of the 53 patients to a nearby hospital while the rest of the 48 will be sent to two quarantine locations to prevent a further spread of the disease, said Deputy Health Minister Hsueh Jui-yuan (薛瑞元).According to the CECC, the nurse (case 156) has no recent overseas travel history and developed a fever, dizziness and general weakness on March 12.She visited a nearby clinic on March 16 but the medication she received did not alleviate her symptoms and she sought further care at a hospital on March 20.Authorities have identified another 14 people who had contact with her before her diagnosis and is closely monitoring their conditions, according to the CECC.Chen said the CECC has not yet been able to pinpoint the origin of the woman's infection, but he believed the nursing home infection was ""manageable"" as its doctors, nurses and residents have all tested negative for COVID-19 and the home has been closed and disinfected.The two other cases in which the disease was contracted locally (cases 168 and 169) are a German in his 30s and an Austrian in her 30s who are believed to have been infected with the coronavirus from a previous confirmed case (case 124).Both of them were quarantined at home before they tested positive for COVID-19.Meanwhile, of the 13 new imported cases, two of them (cases 161 and 162) were members of a tour group that visited Egypt from March 3 to 12. They two developed symptoms during home quarantines on March 20.These latest additions mean eight members of the tour group and a family member of one of the eight, have so far tested positive for COVID-19. Health authorities are monitoring the health of people they came in contact with on the airplane and after returning to Taiwan, the CECC said.The remaining imported cases showed symptoms of infection between March 7 and March 20 during and after traveling to the U.S., Egypt, Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., Denmark, New Zealand and the Philippines.As of Sunday, 133 of the 169 confirmed cases in Taiwan have been classified as imported, the CECC said.Globally, over 297,207 COVID-19 cases and at least 12,790 deaths had been reported in 165 countries/territories worldwide, according to the CECC.Currently, 28 of the 169 coronavirus patients in Taiwan have been released from quarantine, while two patients have died.

03/22/2020,"Taipei, March 22 (CNA) The number of passengers who arrived and departed from Taoyuan International Airport on Saturday fell below the daily average handled by the airport at the height of the SARS outbreak in 2003, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said Sunday.Only about 7,800 people took flights to or from Taiwan's main international gateway on Saturday, down about 1,700 passengers from the 9,500 who used the airport a day earlier.That daily traffic was well below the 9,300 passengers handled on average by the airport in May 2003 at the height of the SARS crisis when economic activity in Taiwan and in the region grounded to a halt, according to NIA statistics.Passenger numbers at the Taoyuan airport have been plummeting since Taiwan and the global community began imposing travel restrictions in January to limit the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).Recent restrictions have hit particularly hard.On March 19, Taiwan began barring most foreign nationals from entering the country, and requiring foreigners who can enter the country and Taiwanese citizens to go into self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.That move, along with the issuance of the highest Level 3 travel alert for the entire world -- essentially telling Taiwanese residents not to travel abroad -- and border controls put in place in other countries have seriously deterred demand for airline travel.Saturday's passenger traffic at the Taoyuan airport was far below the average daily traffic of 133,300 passengers in January (which was nearly identical to the 133,400 passengers averaged in all of 2019) and an estimated 70,000 passengers per day in February.Because of plunging demand, airlines have been slashing capacity, and on Sunday, roughly three-quarters of scheduled arrivals and departures at Taoyuan International Airport were canceled, leaving only about 160 flights operating, according to the airport's website.In 2003, the SARS epidemic infected over 8,000 people and killed more than 770 across the world.

03/22/2020,"Taipei, March 22 (CNA) A ministerial meeting of Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) member economies in August could help Taiwan's bid to join the Japan-led trade initiative, a Taiwanese official told CNA on Sunday.The CPTPP, a trade agreement that arose after the United States pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in January 2017, consists of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.On Saturday, Nikkei Asian Review reported that Japan will make a fresh attempt to expand the trade pact to include more Asian economies, such as Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines.Describing the report as ""good news for Taiwan,"" Minister without Portfolio John Deng (鄧振中) said CPTPP member economies are set to convene a cabinet-level meeting in Mexico this August, and it will be worth watching to see if the inclusion of new members will be on its agenda.The meeting is currently in limbo because of the growing new coronavirus pandemic, but Taiwan's government will continue lobbying for its inclusion with Japan, which plays a leading role in the CPTPP, he said.Taiwan has a longstanding trade relationship with Japan and has long expressed its interest in joining the trade pact, Deng said, citing such efforts as lowering import duties on 15 Japanese agricultural and fishery products, including yams and rice wine.Meanwhile, Roy Chun Lee (李淳), deputy director of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research's Taiwan WTO & RTA Center, said Taiwan can be a plus for CPTPP as it has tens of thousands of capable businessmen scattered around the world.In view of the current situation in which regional integration mechanisms face challenges, and China's economy is at risk of recession due to the U.S.-China trade war and the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, Taiwan's inclusion in the CPTPP could give the group new momentum, Lee argued.The gross domestic product (GDP) of the CPTPP member economies totals US$10.2 trillion, accounting for 13.6 percent of global GDP, while Taiwan's trade with CPTPP member economies accounts for more than one-fourth of Taiwan's external trade value, government data showed.According to the group's executive committee meeting in Tokyo on January 18, 2019, the inclusion of a new member will be decided by consensus.As a practice, an economy that wants to be included needs to file an application and solicit support informally from member economies.(By Liu Pei-cheng and Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003220012
03/22/2020,"Tainan, March 22 (CNA) A retired National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) professor has become the first Taiwanese to win a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) honorary award, the school said Sunday.The OIE confers the award annually for outstanding contributions to the control of animal disease and/or veterinary public health, and Luo Chu-fang (羅竹芳), a former chair professor at NCKU, was one of the winners in 2020.She was honored for her research into shrimp diseases that has led to her lab earning renown for studying new shrimp diseases and the development of diagnostic tools to detect viral diseases in shrimp, the school said in a statement.Luo was previously affiliated with National Taiwan University (NTU) before transferring to NCKU in 2013 and had taught there until she retired last month.Despite her retirement, Luo's enthusiasm for research remains unabated, and she is now busy establishing the country's first standardized shrimp breeding area in Hualien, the statement said.Luo had no experience in studying crustaceans until 1994, when she witnessed the major impact of the white spot syndrome virus in shrimp on the aquaculture industry and decided to dive into the field.Her research at the time on the pathogenic mechanisms of white spot disease (WSD), an infection from the white spot syndrome virus, was very important, according to a shrimp industry player.Scientists originally thought WSD was caused by a baculovirus, but Luo used DNA sequencing and viral pathogen assembly mechanisms to determine it was caused by a new virus.Because of her research, the lab she led was designated as a reference lab by the OIE, according to Luo.The retired professor said she did most of her basic research and published several papers on shrimp breeding while teaching at NTU, and then after transferring to NCKU used the results to help aquaculture farmers develop their businesses.During her time at NCKU, Luo studied the breeding of specific pathogen free (SPF) shrimp and cultured shrimp resistant to viral diseases, set up an R&D center for shrimp aquaculture and built a high-tech shrimp farm to promote a new form of shrimp farming management.In 2013, Luo collaborated with researchers in Thailand to develop diagnostic kits for the detection of viral diseases in shrimp that have been of tremendous benefit to the marine biotechnology industry and shrimp aquaculture, according to NCKU.(By Yang Sz-ruei and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003220010

03/22/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan reported 16 new infections of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, on Sunday (March 22), for a total of 169.

Of the 16 patients to have contracted the viral disease, 13 are imported cases and the other three are local infections. Most of the patients, ranging from 10 to 70 years old, have recently been to Europe, the U.S., the Middle East, and Pacific nations that have reported coronavirus cases.

One of the three locally infected patients, case No. 156, is a caregiver in her 20s serving at two care institutions in the same building. A total of 81 people, including 53 residents and 28 employees from the institutions, tested negative after the caregiver’s infection was confirmed on Saturday (March 21).

The information was passed on by Deputy Health Minister Hsueh Jui-yuan (薛瑞元) at a press conference on Sunday afternoon. He added 14 people who also have had contact with the caregiver are waiting for their test results.

The residents have been moved on to other institutions where they will be cared for separately for two weeks. The 28 employees have been asked to carry out 14-day self-isolation, said Hsueh, adding the institutions would be disinfected.

The caregiver had a fever on March 12 and she went to a doctor three days later. She returned to the hospital on Friday (March 20) and was later tested for the virus, Hsueh said. The origin of infection is not yet known, he added.

The other two locally transmitted cases are both doctorate researchers working with case No. 124, a Taiwanese man in his 30s. Case No. 168 is a German in his 30s, while an Austrian (Case. 169) in her 30s also tested positive for the coronavirus.

It turned out that all three had been infected by their advisor, a Taiwanese in his 50s who has earlier traveled to the U.S., said the Central Epidemic Command Center. The advisor, identified as case No. 160, was the first to have shown symptoms but No. 124 was the first among the four to have been diagnosed, the command center added.

The rest of the latest confirmed cases are Taiwanese who recently arrived from overseas, including a 10-year-old boy returning to Taiwan from the U.K. He was stopped at the airport as he had a fever, fatigue, and coughing.

Among the new cases, five went to a doctor and were given tests, while 10 reported to the authorities after showing symptoms during home quarantine.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3902179

She later fell into a coma and was placed on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device, the hospital said in a statement.ECMO is used to provide cardiac and respiratory support when a patient's heart and lungs are unable to provide the perfusion required to sustain life.Because Liu's heart function failed to recover after the operation, on Feb. 13 she was fitted with a paracorporeal pump, a ventricular assist device used by patients with acute and chronic heart failure, according to the statement.However, she required emergency operations late February and early March due to cerebral thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhaging, side effects of installing the device, the hospital said.Liu, graduated from National Chengchi University and was widely known as Taiwan's ""queen of ballroom dancing.""Liu started ballet lessons when she was a child and continued her studies for 12 years.

03/23/2020,"Taipei, March 23 (CNA) Taiwan has not yet reached the point that it can export surgical masks to diplomatic allies in need amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) declared Monday, dismissing online misinformation that it gave away masks to an ally as a diplomatic favor.""Taiwan's medical aid to diplomatic allies is provided based upon specific circumstances,"" Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) said, and the supplements donated by Taiwan are all purchased locally in the ally countries, in accordance with their needs.Now ""the time is not yet ripe"" for Taiwan to export medical supplies like surgical masks to diplomatic allies, unless the country's own domestic demand is satisfied, Wu emphasized.He was answering questions from reporters about misinformation that MOFA violated the export ban to ""toady to"" Paraguay with a donation of 100,000 masks, while Taiwan is still suffering a great shortage of masks amid the pandemic.MOFA issued a statement Saturday in which it rebutted the accusation and said it had informed the relevant authorities of the misinformation circulation.On Monday, Wu said at the legislative Foreign and National Defense Committee hearing that the masks Taiwan provided to Paraguay were all purchased in other Latin American countries at the price of US$0.4 each, instead of those made in Taiwan.Restricted by limited output of the providers in that region, Taiwan has so far given away only 100,000 masks to Paraguay in its plan to aid the pandemic-hit ally with 1 million masks, he said.Wu, however, also told lawmakers that Taiwan is facing a diplomatic challenge from China, who he said made contact with Paraguay before Taiwan's mask donations to make mask offers of its own.Because of China's suppression and ally poaching, Taiwan currently maintains diplomatic links with just 15 countries, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean.Taiwan imposed a provisional ban on mask exports in late January after it reported the first confirmed case of the COVID-19 coronavirus infection.The ban, which was set to be effective until Feb. 23, has been prolonged until April 30, as well as the government's requisition of surgical masks nationwide.Meanwhile, at the Legislative Yuan on Monday, Wu was also asked by lawmakers about Taiwan's mask offers that were written in a joint statement between Taiwan and the United States for joint efforts to combat COVID-19.Under the joint statement signed on March 18 by Wu and Brent Christensen, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the U.S. promised to reserve raw materials for 300,000 medical protective suits for Taiwan, while Taiwan agreed to provide 100,000 medical face masks per week to the U.S. when its production capacity has stabilized.Wu confirmed that it is a formal ""government-to-government"" statement, despite the fact that there are no diplomatic links between Taiwan and the U.S.As for when Taiwan will begin to provide the U.S. with the promised 100,000 masks per week, Wu said the two sides are still discussing details of the matter.In addition, the U.S. side has not yet settled on when it will begin shipments of its promised raw materials for 300,000 medical protective suits for Taiwan, Deputy Foreign Minister Hsu Szu-chien (徐斯儉) said.According to Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花), Taiwan is in need of 1 million medical protective suits, and currently, only two companies in the world -- one in Japan and the other in the U.S. -- produce the key materials for such products.Although a Taiwanese company has successfully produced medical-degree cloth for protective suits, its output can satisfy local demand by only 10 percent, Wang said.(By Chen Yun-yu and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003230018

One consists of those who have come in contact with people from foreign countries who had respiratory symptoms and a fever.The other consists of people with pneumonia or who have a fever and respiratory symptoms after returning from countries on the highest risk travel warning list.(By Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003240013
03/24/2020,"Taipei, March 24 (CNA) Yang Chin-long (楊金龍), governor of Taiwan's central bank said Monday that Taiwan has no problems with U.S. dollar liquidity, at a time when central banks around the world are seeking greenback funding through foreign exchange swap deals with the U.S. Federal Reserve.Questioned by Chiu Hsien-chih (邱顯智), a lawmaker from the opposition New Power Party (NPP), Yang said the central bank has signed forex swap deals with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and several other financial institutions so the supply of U.S. dollars in Taiwan is not a problem.Yang made the remarks when he met with the NPP legislative caucus earlier in the day, discussing U.S. dollar liquidity in Taiwan as demand for the U.S. currency has risen, with many investors moving their funds into greenback-denominated assets as a safe haven amid escalating concerns over the spread of COVID-19.After Yang met Chiu, and two other NPP lawmakers -- Wang Wan-yu (王婉諭) and Chen Jiau-hua (陳椒華) -- in a closed door meeting, Chiu told reporters what the central bank governor said when asked whether it would be necessary for the local central bank to sign a U.S. dollar swap deal with the Fed to boost greenback funding and avoid a credit crunch in Taiwan.On March 19, the Fed signed a foreign exchange swap deal with its counterparts in nine countries including Australia, Brazil and South Korea to combat a shortage of U.S. dollars caused by an escalation in COVID-19 contagion.The deals with the nine countries followed similar agreements signed between the Fed and its counterparts in five countries including Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan on March 15.According to the Fed, the swap deals, wherein the U.S. central bank accepts other currencies in exchange for dollars, aim to reduce the strain in global U.S. dollar funding markets and ameliorate the effects of these strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both at home and abroad.According to Chiu, Yang said although the central bank has not signed a forex swap agreement with the Fed, similar deals with the BIS and other financial institutions have allowed the central bank to pledge U.S. treasuries it owns as collateral to secure short term U.S. dollar loans if Taiwan faces a greenback shortage.At present, Yang said he did not see any urgent need for Taiwan to sign a forex swap deal with the Fed.Meanwhile, making supplementary comments on Yang's meeting with the NPP legislative caucus, an official from the central bank told CNA that Taiwan's economy remains sound compared with other countries, and Taiwan's greenback funding has been long term sufficient.More important, the official said Taiwan has large forex reserves and the central bank is committed to maintaining ample reserves by improving investment returns to guarantee secure financial markets at home, even if foreign institutional investors move funds out of the country.At the end of February, Taiwan's forex reserves hit a new high of US$479.68 billion, up US$549 million from a month earlier.At a quarterly policymaking meeting held last week, the central bank, after taking into account the impact of COVID-19, cut its growth forecast for Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 from 2.57 percent, made in December, to 1.92 percent.(By Pan Tzu-yu, Wang Yang-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003240009

With each machine able to manufacture 100,000 masks per day, the country's daily mask production jumped from 4 million to 10 million.Reflecting that increase, on March 5 the government raised the mask ration to three adult-sized or five child-sized masks per week.Aside from the technicians themselves, the mobilization's success owed no small debt to the sacrifices made by the 26 requisitioned manufacturers.Huang Che-chun (黃哲諄), chief executive of Sumeasy Enterprises in Keelung City, told CNA he was busy planning his Feb. 22 wedding when he learned that his factory had been requisitioned on Jan. 31.According to Huang, his wife was initially against postponing their plans, arguing that they had already taken their wedding photos and sent out invitations.What convinced her, Huang said, was an honest assessment of the risks. He explained: ""Most of our guests would have come from the industry. If one person was infected, we'd all end up in quarantine and the country's mask production would drop by a third!""""We couldn't take that kind of risk,"" he said.Still, Huang admitted the recent weeks have been challenging. Instead of going on his honeymoon, he has been working 12-hour days, and has had to cancel NT$4 million (US$132,311) in export contracts.Despite the personal costs, his company has expanded from four to nine production lines, while its daily capacity has grown from 400,000 to 1 million masks.From a citizen's perspective, Huang said he sympathized with the government's intervention, without which, he conceded, ""it would be very difficult to guarantee Taiwan's face mask supply.""The team began the second phase of its work on March 6, assembling an additional 32 supply lines, which will boost Taiwan's daily production capacity to a planned 13 million masks by early April.On March 20, it had already completed 28 of the machines, and held a handover ceremony for 15 of them at Chang Hong Machinery, in New Taipei's Wugu District.At the ceremony, Hsu Wen-hsien (許文憲), chairman of the Taiwan Machine Tool and Accessory Builders' Association and one of the project's main organizers, marveled at the industry's response in a time of crisis.When this started in early February, there was so much to consider that ""I felt like I was walking in quicksand,"" Hsu said, adding that to have come so far in a month and a half felt ""unbelievable.""Seeing the scale of the harm caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Hsu said he hoped that after stabilizing Taiwan's mask supply, the team will have the chance to help other countries to deal with their own shortages.In the meantime, he said, the ""national team"" and the manufacturing industry as a whole remain ready to help, for as long as the pandemic continues.Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003240015
03/24/2020,"Taipei, March 24 (CNA) Shares in Taiwan staged a strong rebound Tuesday from a plunge the previous session, with market sentiment boosted by the U.S. Federal Reserve launching limitless quantitative easing and the hope that a massive stimulus package to combat the coronavirus COVID contagion will pass the U.S. Senate, dealers said.Buying in large cap stocks increased across the board as bargain hunters turned active, while government-led funds apparently took advantage of the improved mood to enter the market, helping the main board close up almost 400 points to pass the 9,200 point level, they said.The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) or the Taiex ended up 395.59 points, or 4.45 percent, at 9,285.62, after moving between 9,083.78 and 9,415.64, on turnover of NT$153.39 billion (US$5.06 billion).The market opened up 2.18 percent in a reaction to significant gains posted by Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, which soared more than 4 percent at one point, on the back of the Fed's announcement of unlimited purchases of bonds and mortgage-backed securities from the market, which is expected to pump large funds into the equity markets, dealers said.Despite the failure of a procedural vote in the Senate on a fiscal stimulus package Sunday, U.S. lawmakers kept working to make a deal, which prompted many local investors to think positively on the economy, dealers added.However, with the Taiex breaching the 9,400 point mark at one point, some selling emerged to cap the upturn by the end of the session, while large cap stocks in the bellwether electronics sector dominated the session, dealers said.""To the stock markets, the unlimited QE means a weaker U.S. dollar, which is expected to lead foreign investors to move their funds into the region,"" Mega International Investment Services Corp. analyst Alex Huang said. ""Under such circumstances, Taiwan will be one of the beneficiaries.""""I suspect government-led funds also made their presence in the market as the government simply wants to see a booming equity market,"" Huang said.On the hope that liquidity will go higher, investors scrambled to pick up tech heavyweights which had been battered in recent sessions with contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the most heavily weighted stock on the local market, in focus.After falling 5.56 percent on Monday, TSMC rose 4.90 percent to close at NT$267.50 with 81.86 million shares changing hands. Led by TSMC, the electronics sector and the semiconductor sub-index ended up 4.70 percent and 5.16 percent, respectively.Also in the tech sector, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, gained 2.81 percent to end at NT$69.40, and Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses to Apple Inc., grew 6.23 percent to close at NT$3,665.00.Integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. extended its gains from a session earlier, up 7.14 percent to end at NT$330.00 after the company started a share buyback program Monday.Dealers said bargain hunting also lifted old economy and financial stocks throughout the session.Among the rebounding old economy stocks, food brand Uni-President Enterprises Corp. rose 6.39 percent to close at NT$66.60, Taiwan Cement Corp. added 5.96 percent to end at NT$38.25, and textile maker Far Eastern New Century Corp. grew 4.15 percent to close at NT$21.35.Although concerns over a weakening energy market remain, Formosa Plastics Corp. rose 5.70 percent to close at NT$70.50, and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. added 7.95 percent to end at NT$77.40.In the financial sector, which closed up 3.5 percent, E.

03/24/2020,"Taipei, March 24 (CNA) Apple Inc. said Tuesday that it has scrapped an online curb of purchases of iPhones, with market analysts attributing the move to an increase in production of its suppliers, many of which saw an interruption in their output in their production lines in China amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.On its Taiwan website, Apple said it has no longer curbed online purchases of select iPhones and other items after its restrictions were imposed last week.International news media also reported the online purchase limits have been removed from markets such as the United States, China and Hong Kong.According to the curb imposed last week, consumers were limited to online purchases of no more than two of any of its latest iPhone models -- the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max -- that were launched last September.Customers could also buy no more than two of any of its earlier iPhone models -- the iPhone XR, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus -- per online purchase.However, on Apple's China website, consumers there are still allowed to buy up to two iPads and up to five MacBook Airs online, while no limits are set for online purchases for other iPhones.Analysts said the previous quotas had been triggered by a fall in shipments from Apple's suppliers, with production facilities on lockdown in a number of cities to contain the pandemic, disrupting production.The last time Apple put limits on purchases was in 2007, when the iPhone was introduced for the first time, to prevent people from reselling them.Due to the removal of the online purchase limits, many Taiwanese suppliers saw their share prices bouncing back Tuesday from the doldrums a session earlier, analysts said.Among them, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract electronics maker, rose 2.81 percent to close at NT$69.40 and Pegatron Corp., a smaller iPhone assembler, also added 7.68 percent to end at NT$51.90 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.Meanwhile, Largan Precision Co., a supplier of smartphone camera lenses, rose 6.23 percent to close at NT$3,665.00 and rival Genius Electronic Optical Co. gained 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$371.00.(By Jeffrey Wu, Han Ting-ting and Frances Huang) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003240010

They entered Taiwan after traveling abroad between March 12 and March 22, and began showing symptoms between March 15 and March 23, Chen said.The countries they had traveled to before arriving in Taiwan included the United Kingdom, the United States, Egypt, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Turkey and Thailand.According to the CECC, four patients, identified as case numbers 222-225, studied in the same school in the U.K. as case No. 152, who was confirmed with COVID-19 on March 21.The four started showing symptoms up to a week before returning to Taiwan together on March 22, and these cases may indicate there are cluster infections of COVID-19 at their school, Chen said.Another case, case No. 233, also studied in the U.K. and traveled with a high school classmate around the country there before the two returned to Taiwan together on March 21, the CECC said.Though she showed no symptoms upon arrival and went home to self-quarantine, she began to feel sick on March 23 and tested positive for the disease on Wednesday, while her former classmate was confirmed to be infected a day earlier, the CECC said.Also included in the new cases is the latest and 10th case of a cluster infection involving a tour group that traveled to Egypt in early March, the CECC said.According to the CECC, case No. 226 has been under home isolation since a member of the tour group was first confirmed with COVID-19, and began showing symptoms on March 21.The remaining 13 were all individual cases, including an American man in his 30s who works in Taiwan, the CECC said.The U.S. national went home from March 4 to March 18, began showing symptoms two days after returning to Taiwan, and tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, the CECC said.To date, 197 of the 235 cases of the disease recorded to date in Taiwan have been classified as imported, according to CECC data.(By Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003250009

(TSMC), which vaulted the Taiex past the 9,700-point mark before some profit-taking emerged to cap the gains, the dealers said.""Since an intraday low of 8,523 points Wednesday, the Taiex bounced back significantly, so it came as no surprise that the Taiex came off its high today as some investors just wanted to keep cash on hand for the moment,"" Ta Chan Securities analyst Jerry Chen said.Chen attributed Wednesday's gains to the expectations of the passage of the U.S. stimulus package, with lawmakers in Washington coming closer to cutting a deal about the stimulus measures.""The package, along with the U.S. Federal Reserve's unlimited quantitative easing, is expected to prevent enterprises from closure and keep workers on the payrolls,"" Chen said. ""That is expected to boost consumption, a positive step to keep the U.S. economy rolling.""""Therefore, the Dow soared and markets in the regions, including Taiwan, followed suit,"" he said.

03/25/2020,"Taipei, March 25 (CNA) The project to construct a third runway at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport passed an Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) environmental impact assessment Wednesday, a move that drew protests from several environmental protection groups, citing multiple flaws in the project.The project was approved by an EPA environmental impact assessment meeting after facility operator Taoyuan International Airport Corp. (TIAC) promised to strengthen disaster prevention and control measures and hold one aircraft rescue or firefighting drill a year, given that the location is close to an oil storage facility at nearby CPC Corp.The company also promised to conserve more than 1,000 trees in the project area, by transplanting them to a different location when work starts and returning them to the site at a later date.However, environmental protection groups issued a joint statement saying that the committee passed the project without conducting a thorough assessment of risks posed by the CPC oil depot or relocation fees for land expropriation.It is estimated that 2,599 hectares of land will have to be expropriated for the project and an estimated 6,190 households with more than 16,000 residents be forced to relocate, according to the statement.The groups said they do not rule out the possibility of filing an appeal for an administrative remedy.Meanwhile, the company said that building a third runway is part of the airport's efforts to expand its facilities and upgrade services in accordance with the government's Taoyuan Aerotropolis project and to boost the local economy.It contended that as the airport is the country's main gateway there is an urgent need for a third runway. In addition, after the third runway, which is on the north side, is built, the runway on the south side will be used less frequently, thereby reducing air and noise pollution.(By Chang Hsiung-feng, Wu Jui-chi and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003250025

03/25/2020,"Taipei, March 25 (CNA) Researchers in Taiwan have identified an antioxidant compound in locally grown black tea leaves, as a potential inhibitor of protease activity in SARS‐CoV‐2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital said Wednesday.A Taiwanese research team led by Wu Ching-yuan (吳清源), head of the hospital's Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, used a high-performance computing system to identify potential antiviral components and herbals in traditional plants, the university said in a statement that day.After undertaking research, the team found that theaflavin, a polyphenolic compound in black tea, shows broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against several viruses and could be used as a lead compound for the development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV-2) inhibitor that targets an enzyme known as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).In coronaviruses, RdRp is an important protease that catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target, according to Wu.SARS-CoV-2 virus RdRp is also a primary target for the antiviral drug, remdesivir. which has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the most promising drug currently available for the treatment of COVID-19, Wu noted.Remdesivir works by inhibiting RdRp, which many RNA viruses -- including coronaviruses -- use to replicate themselves.The antiviral effects of theaflavin are similar to those of remdesivir, Wu said.However, the exact in vivo effect is still unclear, and further research is needed to confirm the mechanism whereby theaflavin targets SARS‐CoV‐2, Wu stressed.The findings were published by the American Society for Microbiology March 13 in the Journal of Medical Virology, according to the Chiayi hospital.(By Tsai Chi-ming and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202003250015
03/25/2020,"Taipei, March 25 (CNA) The Yuanta-Polaris Research Institute, one of Taiwan's leading economic think tanks, said Wednesday that it has lowered its forecast for Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2020 to 1.5 percent, citing the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.Yuanta-Polaris said the latest forecast represents a 0.7 percentage point downgrade from a previous estimate made in September 2019, as it is impossible for Taiwan to isolate itself from the global damage caused by the virus, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December, and has spread worldwide.The think tank simply joined other institutions to cut Taiwan's 2020 GDP growth forecast below the 2 percent mark after taking into account the COVID-19 spread.Last week, Taiwan's central bank downgraded its forecast for Taiwan's GDP growth for 2020 to 1.92 percent from the previous forecast of 2.57 percent, made in December.In early March, Standard Chartered announced that it expects that Taiwan's GDP will grow 1.9 percent in 2020, a downgrade from its previous forecast of 2.2 percent made in early February.Liang Kuo-yuan (梁國源), president of the think tank, told reporters that the virus spread has prompted many consumers here to stay at home and that the impact on business is expected to lead to an increase in workers who suffer unpaid leave.In addition, Liang said, lockdowns imposed by China and a group of other countries to contain the virus have interrupted Taiwan's exports and imports.Due to economic uncertainty created by the pandemic, Liang added, enterprises might scale down their investments.As a result, Yuanta-Polaris has cut its forecast for Taiwan's private consumption and private investment growths for 2020 to 1.04 percent and 2.79 percent, respectively, from an earlier estimate of 2.00 percent and 3.08 percent.The think tank has also lowered its forecasts for Taiwan's growth of merchandise and service exports and imports for 2020 to 1.27 percent and 1.30 percent, respectively, from 3.13 percent and 3.33 percent.However, Yuanta-Polaris has raised its forecast for Taiwan's capital formation growth to 3.85 percent from 3.54 percent, citing an increase in government investment aimed at alleviating the impact of the virus spread.According to the think tank, investment from the government is estimated to grow by 5.31 percent in 2020, a significant upgrade from its earlier forecast of 2.92 percent.Yuanta-Polaris said Taiwan's GDP is expected to grow 1.10 percent, 1.12 percent, 1.55 percent and 2.18 percent in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of this year, respectively.Liang said that how the global economy will develop this year will continue to be dictated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and a rebound is unlikely until the third quarter or even in the fourth quarter.(By Pan Tzu-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003250008

03/26/2020,"Taipei, March 26 (CNA) Seventeen new cases of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 were confirmed in Taiwan on Thursday, bringing the total to 252 since the pandemic began, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said.All of the new patients -- nine males and eight females -- are Taiwanese nationals, said Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC.Of the 17 new cases, 15 were imported, while the other two were infected by family members who had recently returned from overseas and had earlier tested positive for COVID-19, Chen said.In one of the local infections, the man in his 60s contracted the virus from a family member who had visited the United States in early January and was diagnosed with COVID-19 a few days after returning to Taiwan on March 19.The new patient was tested because of his proximity to that family member but had not been showing any symptoms of COVID-19, the CECC said.The other case of local transmission, a woman in her 40s, was infected by a Taiwanese student based in the Netherlands, who returned home on March 17 and was diagnosed Wednesday with COVID-19.The woman, a relative of the student, developed COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and fatigue, on March 23 and was confirmed Thursday to have the disease, according to the CECC.Meanwhile, the 15 patients deemed to have contracted COVID-19 overseas all returned to Taiwan in the period March 16-23, and reported that their symptoms started between March 11 and March 23, the CECC said.The countries they had visited were the U.S., the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, Malaysia, Monaco and Mexico, according to the CECC.One of those cases is the latest in a cluster infection among a tour group that had traveled to Spain recently, the CECC said.Although the latest case was asymptomatic, he was tested because two other people in the same group were confirmed this week to have contracted the disease, the CECC said.The other 14 new patients confirmed Thursday were all individual cases, including six who had traveled to the U.K., the CECC said.As of Thursday, 212 of Taiwan's 252 cases had been classified as imported, while the other 40 are believed to be local infections, the CECC said.Twenty-nine of Taiwan's COVID-19 patients have been released from quarantine, while two have died. The others are still in negative pressure quarantine rooms in hospital but are all in relatively stable condition, the CECC said.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 455,753 patients in 176 countries and regions, including 81,285 in China, 74,386 in Italy and 65,174 in the U.S, with 20,740 fatalities to date, according to the CECC.(By Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003260009
03/26/2020,"Taipei, March 26 (CNA) Taiwan's constitutional court will hear arguments March 31 on whether an article in the Criminal Code that punishes adultery is unconstitutional, after receiving requests from 14 judges and a defendant in an adultery case to do so.Article 239 of the Criminal Code stipulates that a married person who commits adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, with the other party to the adultery subject to the same punishment, though there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.According to one of the judges who applied for a constitutional interpretation, the article could be at odds with the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and infringes on people's rights, including an individual's right to privacy and bodily autonomy.Women's groups in Taiwan have also voiced their support for the decriminalization of adultery, as they believe the article fails in its stated purpose of keeping marriages intact.""During the court proceedings, people's intimate acts need to be laid bare in court, which destroys the last piece of emotion and trust between a couple,"" said Chuang Chiao-ju (莊喬汝), chairperson of the women's rights group Awakening Foundation, at a Thursday press conference.This leads to a breakdown in communication, which could have led to the couple deciding to work on their marriage or an uncontested divorce, Chuang said.The article has also disproportionately punished women, said lawyer Lin Shih-fang (林實芳), another member of the Awakening Foundation.Men and women are sued for adultery on a ratio of 111 to 100, Lin said, but the ratio of men to women who end up convicted is 81.3 to 100.This indicates that women are likely pressured by their husbands to drop charges against them during the proceedings, yet the charges against the mistresses go ahead, Lin said.In most legal cases, if a plaintiff wishes to drop charges against one party in a lawsuit, the charges for the remaining parties are also dropped, though that is not true for adultery cases.In this situation, the complainant can choose to drop charges on their spouse but still sue the other party, though they cannot decide to drop charges on the other party and only sue their spouse.This particular rule has another inadvertent consequence, said Humanistic Education Foundation Director Feng Chiao-lan (馮喬蘭), which is that it is often used to threaten victims of rape.Feng gave the example of a case in which a teacher allegedly raped a student, but the student didn't press charges due to the fear of being sued for adultery.In these instances, the adultery article becomes a protective shield for rapists, Feng said.Feng was likely referring to the high profile case of Lin Yi-han (林奕含), a budding writer who committed suicide a few months after the publication of her first novel, which was about a 13-year old girl who was raped by her teacher.After her death, her parents released a statement saying that the story was actually Lin's own experience, and alleging that she was raped by a cram school teacher when she was in high school.The reason why the family chose not to press charges was due to the fear of Lin being countersued for adultery, they said.According to two polls conducted by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in 2013, around 80 percent of Taiwanese are opposed to decriminalizing adultery, while a poll conducted in 2017 by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation found that 69 percent of Taiwanese are opposed.(By Lin Chang-shun and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003260014

03/26/2020,"Taipei, March 26 (CNA) Taiwan government officials said Thursday that a British woman who is in quarantine in Taiwan due to COVID-19 coronavirus control measures has not been ""incarcerated,"" as has been reported by the BBC.At a press conference, Hualien County Health Bureau Director Chu Chia-hsiang (朱家祥) said the woman Natalie Dawson, along with her Australian partner Rohan Pixley, are in quarantine at a facility in Hualien, which was once a school dormitory.They each have a single room of about 26 square meters, which is equipped with internet, a reading desk, chair, bed, and other basic necessities, and they have access to the bathrooms that are on each floor of the building, Chu said.Dawson and Pixley have also been receiving three meals a day during their quarantine, which started shortly after they arrived in Taiwan on March 14, according to Chu.He said when the couple was asked to self-quarantine, the hotel at which they were staying agreed that they could remain there, but they could not afford the cost for an extended period, so they were taken to the former school dorm, at which they pay only NT$250 (US$8.18) each per day for three meals.Chu said he was surprised to see the BBC report, which quoted Dawson's mother as saying that her daughter and Pixley had been separated and ""incarcerated.""""They are locked in and they can't get out,"" the mother Jill Weaver was quoted as saying. ""One man brings them food three times a day. But it is of poor quality and meagre portions.""Weaver also said she was not disputing the need for the quarantine, but rather was taking issue with the conditions in which her daughter was living at the moment.""The room is filthy,"" Weaver was quoted as saying in the BBC report. ""She has no hot water and nowhere to wash her clothes.""In response, Chu said his office had not received any complaints of anyone being locked in at the quarantine facility, but the local government had dispatched police to the site to investigate the claims. He did not say what the police had found.Meanwhile, the British Office in Taipei told CNA Thursday that it has been providing assistance to Dawson, who has special dietary needs.""The staff of the British Office has been working with the Taiwanese authorities to effectively address a number of concerns, including access to food that would meet her essential dietary requirements,"" the office told CNA. ""The Taiwanese authorities have provided her a telephone to maintain contact with family and friends.""The office said its staff has also been providing support to arrange Dawson's onward travel plans when her quarantine ends.According the BBC report, Dawson and Pixley had planned a few days stopover in Taiwan en route to Australia but were told that they had to go into quarantine for 14 days.Also commenting on the issue, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said when Dawson was first taken to the quarantine facility in Hualien, she was given a room with an ensuite bathroom, but she was moved to a different room after she complained that the water heater in the bathroom was not functioning.According to MOFA spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安), Dawson at first was not receiving gluten-free meals, as she had requested, but that was soon addressed.Dawson had also requested that she and Pixley be allowed to stay in the same room, but that was not permitted because it would have defeated the purpose of the quarantine, Ou said.Under Taiwan's current temporary regulations, its borders have been closed to most foreign nationals, and those who entered shortly before the ban was imposed were required to self-quarantine for two weeks, as the country tightened its measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.According to Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), foreign nationals in quarantine in Taiwan may contact the relevant government departments if they need assistance.(By Chen Wei-ting, Chang Chi, Tzeng Yi-shiuan and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003260016

It is aimed at cementing U.S. support for Taiwan's diplomatic alliances around the world, amid pressure from China.The Act authorizes the U.S. State Department to consider ""reducing its economic, security and diplomatic engagements with nations that take serious or significant actions to undermine Taiwan.""It also calls on the U.S. government to help Taiwan gain participation in international organizations, either as a member or an observer, and to express support for Taiwan's international participation whenever Washington has discussions with Beijing.It means that U.S. administrative departments will be encouraged to adopt a so-called diplomatic ""reward/punishment"" program as a countermeasure to China's poaching of Taiwan's diplomatic allies.On the question of whether countries will now be more likely to ""upgrade"" their relations with Taiwan, Curtis said that is the goal.""This is the whole purpose of the bill -- to get people to recognize the importance of Taiwan not just in our relationship but in an international economy,"" he said. ""And we are very hopeful that will have an impact.""Since May 2016 when President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office, Taiwan has lost eight diplomatic allies to China, namely Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, the Solomon Islands, and Kiribati.Currently Taiwan has 15 diplomatic allies, mostly in the Latin American and Caribbean regions.With the TAIPEI Act signed into law, Taiwan is seen as likely to gain U.S. support for its bid to attend a meeting in May of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, particularly in light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.Curtis said the U.S. can learn from Taiwan's prevention and containment response and will work with Taiwan to contain the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19.""We've got to be looking all over the world and seeing what countries that are handling this well, what they're doing, what the procedures are, and how those can be implemented, not just here in the United States, but all over the world,"" he told CNA.Curtis, 59, who speaks fluent Mandarin, has been the representative of the 3rd congressional district of Utah since 2017.

I am sorry if you have read it. I didn't know anything about it until today,"" she told the health bureau.""I appreciate what you have done for myself and Rohan and I can only apologize. I am doing what I can to get it taken down as soon as possible.""She is in quarantine in separate quarters with her Australian partner Rohan Pixley after the two arrived in Taiwan on March 14 for a stop in Taiwan before heading on to Australia and were required to go into quarantine for 14 days.Chung Mei-chu (鍾美珠), the health bureau's deputy chief, said Friday the two are scheduled to be released from quarantine on Saturday at precisely 11:59 p.m.Due to the late hour at which they are to be released and the long distance between the quarantine facility and downtown Hualien, health officials will drop them off at the Hualien train station, she said.The bureau will also explain to her how to seek government compensation of NT$1,000 per day for the period spent in quarantine.According to Chu, individuals, whether Taiwanese or foreign nationals, subject to home isolation or home quarantine for 14 days to prevent the spread of the coronavirus are entitled to monetary compensation for the constraints on their movements.(By Chang Hsin, Tai Ya-chen and Ko Lin) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003270011

Comprising 16 articles, the regulation encompasses occupational safety, food safety, transportation safety, traffic safety, and consumer rights issues. Food delivery workers must have accident insurance and be allowed to cease delivery services when the government announces the suspension of work should a natural disaster, such as a typhoon, occur.

Employers must notify the authorities in the event of an occupational hazard, implement food safety measures, provide new workers with training, explicitly disclose the price of food items, and put in place refund mechanisms, according to the ordinance.

The Department of Labor said businesses will be held accountable if they continue operations when a typhoon strikes. If delivery personnel lose their lives under such circumstances, employers will be fined between NT$20,000 (US$662) and NT$100,000.

The ordinance was enacted in the wake of a series of food delivery-related traffic accidents during the Double Ten Day holiday last October, reported CNA.

03/28/2020,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) A Taiwanese father and son who endured a two-month ordeal in quarantine on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, being treated for the COVID-19 coronavirus in Japan, followed by self-isolation at home in Kaohsiung, have a simple message for the 50,000 Taiwanese currently under home quarantine: Stay at home -- your cooperation could save lives.In an interview with CNA -- the first in which Taiwanese COVID-19 survivors have agreed to disclose their identities -- 85-year-old Mai Wen-ta (麥文達) and 49-year-old Mai Chia-shuo (麥家碩) recounted their experience with the disease and explained why they think such public health measures are necessary.The pair's ordeal began on Jan. 20 when they set sail from Yokohama, Japan on the Diamond Princess.The ship, carrying 3,711 passengers and crew, including 24 Taiwanese, made stops in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa. On Feb. 4, however, it was quarantined in Yokohama Harbor, after it emerged that a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong later tested positive for the virus.As the Japanese authorities began testing the passengers, the Mais were told to remain in their small, windowless cabin. After only three days in the room, Mai Chia-shuo said, he began feeling an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia, which he described as ""like being stuck inside a coffin.""To cope with the isolation, they watched a livestream of the view outside the ship on their television, while friends on board whose cabins had a balcony sent them daily photos of the sun.Within days, however, Mai Wen-ta began suffering nosebleeds and coughing up blood. They reported these symptoms to health authorities aboard the ship, but were told he would have to remain in quarantine unless he had a fever.At that point, said Mai Wen-shuo, ""My main concern was getting my father off the ship"" to get medical treatment.On Feb. 10, he wrote an open letter to Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) in which he described his father's deteriorating health and pleaded for help.The letter was widely covered in the Taiwanese media and drew a quick response from the government, which arranged for doctors to treat Mai Wen-ta and test him for the virus.Both father and son were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 -- on Feb. 13 and 17, respectively -- and were treated at Japanese hospitals over the next several weeks.After they were cleared of the virus, the pair returned to Taiwan on March 10, where they underwent another 14 days of self-health management in Kaohsiung to ensure that they posed no risk to the community.Having come through the experience, Mai Chia-shuo told CNA of his frustration at seeing news reports about people ignoring their home quarantine orders.Such precautions are worth the sacrifice, Mai Chia-shuo stressed, which is why he stayed home, despite testing negative, and missed out on long-awaited reunions with family and friends.In the two months since the Mais boarded the Diamond Princess, the COVID-19 outbreak has burgeoned into a global pandemic, with over 600,000 cases and 27,000 deaths reported as of Saturday.In Taiwan, meanwhile, the number of cases has surged in recent weeks, as an influx of students and travelers have returned from the pandemic's new hotspots, including Europe and the United States.To the 50,000 Taiwanese who, according to Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) statistics, are currently under home quarantine, Mai Chia-shuo could only implore: ""Stay at home to protect yourself and protect others -- that's the best thing you can do.""More personally, Mai Chia-shuo said, the last two months have taught him to value the time he is able to spend with his family, after previously living overseas for more than two decades.""I used to put everything off until tomorrow,"" he said, but after this ""I want to hurry up and do what I should, and not leave behind any regrets.""(By Chang Ming-hsuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003280014
03/28/2020,"Taipei, March 28 (CNA) An escalation of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic around the world continued to deal a blow to consumer confidence in Taiwan, in particular when equity investors were shocked by global volatility, according to National Central University (NCU).Citing a survey conducted during March 19-23, when stock markets at home and abroad encountered headwinds amid escalating fears over the COVID-19 spread, NCU said the consumer confidence index (CCI) for March fell 5.42 points from a month earlier to 78.51, the lowest level since July 2017, when the index stood at 78.19.The CCI reflects public confidence in the coming six months in six different areas -- employment, family finances, consumer prices, the local economic climate, the stock market and the likelihood of purchasing durable goods.In March, the sub-index on the equity market fell 11.8 points from a month earlier to 53.70, the lowest level since January 2013, when the figure stood at 52.70, the survey found. The fall was the steepest among the six CCI factors.Dachrahn Wu (吳大任), director of NCU's Research Center for Taiwan Economic Development, said the COVID-19 pandemic escalated in the United States and Europe in March, sending the global financial markets into a tailspin, which in turn hit the local equity market.The benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, or Taiex, fell below the 10,000-point mark on March 16, and moved below 9,000 later in the month before staging a rebound in line with the U.S. markets in the wake of a move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to launch unlimited quantitative easing and hopes of a massive stimulus package.On Friday, the Taiex closed down 0.38 percent at 9,698.92 points after giving up its earlier gains amid lingering fears over the economic impact resulting from the virus spread.Despite a rebound on Wall Street in recent sessions, Wu said, the jobless claims in the U.S. market last week soared to a record high of 3.28 million, and if the U.S. job market continues to weaken, the country's consumption power will be eroded, which in turn will hurt the global economy.Wu said the Fed has sensed the severity of the economic weakness and so launched the unlimited quantitative easing by buying bonds and mortgage-based securities to lend support to the financial markets in the short term, but it remained to be seen how the real economy will be affected in the longer term.Meanwhile, the sub-index on the timing of purchases of durable goods such as homes and cars stood at 104.45, down 6.6 points from a month earlier, the second-steepest drop among the six factors of the CCI, ahead of a decline of 4.5 points in the sub-index on consumer prices of 46.75, the survey showed.Wu said the coronavirus spread is expected to have an adverse impact on the local property market in the short term but with more and more Taiwanese companies with overseas operations returning home to invest, demand in the property market could improve.The sub-index on family finances came in fourth, registering a decline of 4.3 from a month earlier to 91.95 in March, while the sub-indexes on the local economic climate and employment also dropped 3.9 and 1.4, respectively, to 88.95 and 85.25, the survey indicated.According to the NCU, a sub-index score of 0-100 indicates pessimism, while a score of 100-200 shows optimism.In other words, the sub-index on possible purchases of durable goods indicates optimism for the coming six months, the university said.The survey collected 2,795 valid questionnaires from local consumers aged 20 and over. It had a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points.(By Pan Tzu-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003280008

(FPCC), announced identical price cuts, which will take effect at 1 a.m. Monday.After the adjustments, gasoline prices at CPC pumps will drop to NT$18.2 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$19.7 per liter for 95 unleaded and NT$21.7 per liter for 98 unleaded.The price for 92 octane unleaded was the lowest since Sept. 27, 2002 when it stood at NT$18.5 per liter, according to the company.For super diesel, the retail price will be lowered to NT$15.4 per liter, CPC said.The privately run FPCC said prices at its gas stations will be NT$18.2 per liter for 92 unleaded, NT$19.6 per liter for 95 unleaded, NT$21.7 per liter for 98 unleaded and NT$15.2 per liter for diesel.CPC attributed the price cuts to an increase of output by the major oil producers of Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as a bleak global economic outlook due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The year of 2002 saw slumps in crude oil prices globally due to recession in the aviation and transportation sectors in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001.On Sept. 27, 2002, the CPC price for 92 unleaded came to NT$18.5 per liter and that for 95 unleaded was NT$19.6 per liter, while that for 98 unleaded stood at NT$20.9 per liter and that for super diesel reached NT$ 14.4 per liter.CPC adjusts its fuel prices weekly based on changes in crude oil prices, using a weighted oil price formula composed of 70 percent Dubai crude and 30 percent Brent crude.(By Pan Tze-yu and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003290007
03/29/2020,"Taipei, March 29 (CNA) The government is revising regulations to remove one of the main thresholds for contractors of public construction projects to hire migrant workers, with the new rules likely to come into effect in early April, according to the Ministry of Labor (MOL).Under the MOL's existing regulations, contracted firms engaged in public works must meet three requirements for applying to employ migrant workers -- the total construction project cost must reach NT$10 billion (US$330.93 million), any separate contracts must amount to NT$1 billion and the construction period must be 1.4 years or longer.However, after a Taiwan engineering contractors association complained to the government that the strict restrictions have caused a serious labor shortage in the construction sector, the MOL agreed to remove the NT$10 billion threshold of total construction cost.Once the restrictions are relaxed, an additional 1,382 migrant workers are expected to be able to enter the public construction sector, according to the Public Construction Commission.According to the contractors association, some of its members complained that a labor shortage presents challenges for them because many public projects contracted out have been less than NT$10 billion in recent years, leaving many firms unable to apply to hire migrant workers.Official statistics show that the annual number of migrant workers brought into the construction sector from 2001-2006 breached 10,000, with the number hitting a record high of 33,300 in 2011. However, since 2007, the average number of applications for hiring migrant workers in the sector was below 10,000, with only 4,100 and 4,400 recorded in 2018 and 2019.According to the MOL, between 2001 and 2011, many major public construction projects were launched, leading to the introduction of a large number of migrant workers.In the past few years, although an increasing number of public projects have been launched, they have been small-scale, causing a decline in the applications for hiring migrant workers, the MOL added.(By Pan Yi-ching and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003290008
03/29/2020,"Taipei, March 29 (CNA) An expert specialized in helping victims of sexual abuse called on the public Sunday to take the issue of male rape seriously after a Taiwanese comedian and a Taipei city councilor both recently shared their experiences of being rape victims when they were young.Wang Yue-hao (王玥好), executive director of Taiwan's Garden of Hope Foundation, told CNA that due to local gender stereotyping, people tend to see men as strong and therefore not subject to rape or sexual violence.Rape and sexual assault are not issues that only affect women, Wang said.Wang, who has three decades of counseling experience, said she has offered counseling to male victims of sexual attack, and even though they may be taller and stronger on the outside, they are still vulnerable to verbal or physical intimidation and threats.She cited government numbers showing that the proportion of men who have reported sexual assault has increased significantly over the past decade.According to Ministry of Health and Welfare numbers, only about 3 percent to 5 percent of reported sexual assault victims were male 10 years ago. The percentage of reported cases had increased to around 10 percent in 2019, Wang noted.The rising number of reports from men could also mean that more male sexual abuse victims are willing to seek help, she added.To meet the increasing demand, Wang said her foundation has set up a hotline for men seeking counseling.Wang said it takes tremendous courage for a male sexual abuse victim to seek help or share their pain with their friends or relatives.She therefore called on family members and friends of male victims to trust their stories while expressing a caring attitude toward them and offering help.They should also avoid sharing the intimate stories of such victims to others, which could further traumatize them, she added.Wang made the comments in response to a confession by Taiwanese standup comedian Brian Tseng (曾博恩), who last week disclosed that he was a victim of rape multiple times during his days in elementary and high school.Tseng, however, did not elaborate on whether his assailants were men or women and did not provide more details of the assaults.Tseng also said that as a victim of rape, he believes one can let go of the painful past and move on.Showing support for Tseng, Taipei City Councilor Chiu Wei-chieh (邱威傑), better known as a YouTuber who goes by the name ""Froggy,"" also disclosed Saturday that he too was a victim of rape when he was only 10 years old in elementary school.In a Facebook post, Chiu said the incident took place at a hospital and that his attacker was a man at least 10 years older than him.Chiu said he did not tell anyone about the incident until years later because traditionally, people in Taiwan do not think men can be victims of sexual assault.Sexual assault is an act in which a person coerces another person to engage in a sexual act against their will, and it is a painful experience whether the victim is a man or a woman, he added.(By Chang Hsiung-feng, Huang Li-yun and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003290012
03/29/2020,"Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), expressed hope Sunday that a recent proposal raised by the party to lower the legal voting age to 18 by means of constitutional amendment can be realized soon and put into practice before the 2022 local government elections.

The proposal by the KMT to amend the Constitution to lower the legal voting age to 18 from the current 20 and lower the age of candidacy to 20 from 23 was sent to committee review Friday (March 27).

The party's newly elected chairman, Chiang Chi-chen (江啟臣), then called on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to establish a constitutional reform committee to discuss the issue.

Speaking during a press event Sunday, KMT legislative deputy caucus whip Lin Yi-hua (林奕華) said the party hopes that the proposal will be supported by the public and that the amendments to the Constitution can be passed soon.

KMT Deputy Secretary-General Ko Chih-en (柯志恩), meanwhile, said the century-old KMT has long been regarded as out of touch with young voters. The party's decision to become the first political party in Taiwan to propose constitutional amendments to lower the voting age thus serves as evidence that it is serious about conducting reform and closing the gap with the younger generation, Ko added.

In response to the KMT's call, DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming (柯建銘) said Saturday that his party has been a long-term supporter of both lowering the legal voting age and the age of candidacy.

The party will propose its own versions of the constitutional amendments and form a constitutional reform committee to deal with the matter within the Legislative Yuan, Ko added.

A constitutional amendment committee is an ad hoc body under the Legislative Yuan that requires the participation of at least 33 percent of all 113 lawmakers, with its makeup determined by the proportion of seats each party caucus has on the legislative floor. In Taiwan, a revision to the Referendum Act that took effect in January 2018 lowered the voting age for referendums from 20 to 18.

Lowering the voting age in general elections and the age of candidacy, however, can only be done by amending the Constitution. Such an amendment would be challenging because a motion to amend the Constitution must be sponsored by at least 25 percent of legislators to be valid and approved by at least 75 percent of the members present at a meeting attended by at least 75 percent of the 113 lawmakers.

After the Legislative Yuan passes the resolution to amend the Constitution, it must be referred to a national referendum six months after the government's announcement of the proposed amendment. The referendum needs to be passed by more than half of the total number of eligible voters, which stood at over 19.31 million in 2020, according to Article 12 of the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3906633

03/30/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former Taiwan Premier Hau Pei-tsun ( 郝柏村 ) died at the age of 101 at the Tai-Service General Hospital in Nei Hu District, Taipei on Monday (March 30).

The former top general, born in Jiangsu Province in 1919, enrolled in the R.O.C. Military Academy in 1935. During the early years of World War II, he participated in the Guangzhou Battle (廣州戰役) against the Japanese, and he later fought them again with the Chinese Expeditionary Force from 1942 to 1945, the Liberty Times reported.

In 1949, he came to Taiwan with the retreating Nationalist Party’s (KMT) troops. In 1958, when the August 23 Artillery Battle broke out, Hau was the division commander of the Army responsible for defending Little Kinmen, also called Lieyu. After the battle was over, he was awarded medals for successful defense of the islet.

Hau was promoted to the rank of four-star general by then President Chiang Ching-kuo (蔣經國) and tapped as Chief of the General Staff in 1981, a post he held for eight years, longer than any other top general in that position.

After Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) became president of Taiwan in 1988, Hau was promoted to the position of minister of national defense in 1989 and then premier in 1990. The new premier’s assumption of office drew protests from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which was opposed to ""using a serviceman to interfere with politics.” Hau resigned as premier in 1993.

However, Lee later revealed that his secret intention in tapping Hau as premier was to make him retire from the military and end his power over that institution.

Hau exited the KMT in 1995 and became Lin Yang-kang’s (林洋港) running mate in the country’s first direct presidential election in 1996. They were defeated by Lee, who won reelection. Hau’s KMT membership was voluntarily restored by the party in 2005.

Hau became a Christian and was baptized at the age of 98. He was hospitalized at the Tai-Service General Hospital in April last year, and he died Monday from stroke-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Hau is survived by his son, former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin (郝龍斌).",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3907313
03/30/2020,"Taipei, March 30 (CNA) Taiwan needs to increase testing and implement social distancing regulations to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, public health experts said Monday at a weekly press conference.The number of COVID-19 cases in Taiwan has been relatively low because the government imposed travel restrictions early, but new measures are now necessary to flatten the curve before the infections reach 1,000, said Chan Chang-chuan (詹長權), dean of National Taiwan University's College of Public Health (NTUCPH).Furthermore, the country's quarantine measures will be more effective if they are combined with increased testing, Chan said at the press conference at NTUCPH in Taipei.Also speaking at the press event, NTUCPH Vice Dean Chen Hsiu-hsi (陳秀熙) said Taiwan should expand COVID-19 testing to include everyone arriving from abroad and members of the communities in which infections have been confirmed.""It is only through testing that we can find all the infections lurking in the corners of society,"" Chan said. ""We are not hunting for the infected, but instead we are looking for the virus so we can stop its transmission.""The issue of testing came to the fore last weekend, when Taiwan reported 31 new COVID-19 cases, including a man in his 50s who developed symptoms as far back as Feb. 28 but was not tested during his many visits to the doctor, apparently because he had no recent history of overseas travel.It was not until March 26 when he went to the hospital with severe breathing difficulty and a fever that he was suspected of having COVID-19, and he was confirmed on March 28, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said in a news briefing Sunday.The patient has an underlying chronic respiratory illness, the CECC said.Meanwhile, NTUCPH professor Lin Hsien-ho (林先和) said at Monday's press conference that social distancing regulations are also important in the efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19.Unlike SARS in 2003, COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms in more than half of the patients, and many are asymptomatic in the early stages of the infection, Lin said.He suggested the implementation of social distancing regulations that would limit physical interaction between people and keep them at least two meters apart in public spaces.Citing Singapore's measures, he said markers can be placed on escalators and in queues to guide people on the distance that must be maintained.At a legislative hearing Monday, Deputy Health Minister Hsueh Jui-yuan (薛瑞元) said regulations for social distancing are currently being planned and will be implemented in the three phases -- setting guidelines and building a general consensus, promoting the policy through counseling and education, and imposing fines for non-compliance.On Monday, Taiwan reported eight new COVID-19 infections and another two deaths, bringing its total number of cases to 306 and its fatalities to five, since the coronavirus emerged in China at the end of last year.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003300016

Although the current situation in most of Asia is not as severe as in Europe and the U.S., Kasai said during a virtual media briefing that there will most likely be large-scale community transmissions in Eastern countries as well. He added that all the preventive measures being adopted are only buying time for Asian countries to prepare for the inevitable escalation of the outbreak.

The Japanese doctor emphasized that these measures ""will not make the risk go away"" as long as the pandemic continues. He went on to predict that the battle against the coronavirus will last longer than expected and that no nation should let its guard down, reported CNA.

Kasai warned that countries that have seen a decline in their number of COVID-19 cases should continue to monitor the health of all their citizens and prevent the virus from surging back. He said the global health authorities will continue to provide assistance to areas with limited resources, such as the Pacific Islands.

Differences in countries' circumstances or overall sizes mean their responses will vary, he said.More specifically, Su said, the government will reallocate NT$40 billion in existing funds to tackle the crisis, which, combined with the earlier bill, would equal NT$100 billion.Beyond that, Taiwan's Central Bank could inject up to NT$200 billion into the market, while other public funds could contribute NT$400 billion, he said, with total public expenditure of NT$1 trillion possible, based on how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out.Executive Yuan spokesperson Kolas Yotaka re-emphasized the NT$1 trillion figure during an interview later that day, noting that the expenditure would amount to around 5 percent of Taiwan's GDP.In addition to the NT$60 billion special budget and the NT$40 billion in fund reallocation requested by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Central Bank, postal savings system and state-owned banks have also authorized financing of up to NT$700 billion, Kolas said.The government also plans to request another NT$100 billion via special budget, she said, adding that it will make a formal proposal in the ""near term.""While the government is still holding talks on the allocation of stimulus funds, ideas under consideration include cash payments to private citizens, as well as bailouts for the restaurant, aviation, transportation, tourism and hotel industries, she said.(By Chen Chun-hua, Ku Chuan and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202003310025
03/31/2020,"Taipei, March 31 (CNA) Several prosecutors in Taiwan voiced support for decriminalizing adultery on Tuesday as Taiwan's Constitutional Court was hearing arguments that treating adultery as a crime is unconstitutional.Eighteen judges and a defendant in an adultery case have asked the court several times over the years for a constitutional interpretation of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, and the court finally agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.The article stipulates that a married person who commits adultery and the other party to the adultery shall be sentenced to prison for less than one year, but there can be no trial without a complaint from the alleged victim.A head prosecutor, who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity, said that while it may seem Article 239 is necessary to keep families intact, in reality, it does not help reduce divorce rates.Considering that the court proceedings also waste judicial resources and force spouses to confront each other in court, it is questionable whether criminalizing adultery is even necessary, he said.Another problem, the source said, is that judges often require alleged victims to prove their spouses had sex with a third party, which can force complainants to violate privacy laws when trying to collect evidence.If the complainant is then counter-sued for violating privacy laws, the question of who is actually punished during court proceedings for adultery becomes murky, he said.Another head prosecutor told CNA that the punishment for committing adultery is meaningless, as the sentence imposed is almost always commutable to a fine.""How could a change in one's feelings possibly be altered by a fine of some hundreds of thousands of dollars?"" she questioned, adding that a verdict could not help rebuild a relationship when it is already broken beyond repair.Meanwhile, a head prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) told CNA that Taiwanese society has yet come to a consensus over whether to decriminalize adultery.The most recent government-led public opinion poll on the topic was posted on an Executive Yuan website in 2016, according to Lin Ying-tzu (林映姿).A total of 10,755 people participated, with 85 percent of them opposed to the decriminalization of adultery, Lin said, while a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll in 2017 found that 69 percent of people were opposed.Lin said most people seem to be opposed to the idea of decriminalizing adultery based on social morality and may find it hard to accept if the law were immediately abolished.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation, a nongovernmental organization that led the charge against same-sex marriage in referendums held in November 2018, said it opposed decriminalization of adultery.The group argued in a statement that the law ""strengthens people's respect of marriage and protects the institution of marriage and the family.""The group rejected the argument that the article should be abolished if it fails in its stated purpose to deter people from committing adultery.""If we follow this logic, then we should also abolish homicide-related laws if they cannot prevent people from committing murder,"" it said.(By Hsiao Po-wen, Liu Shih-i, Chang Hsiung-feng, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003310017

They include TTFB Company Limited, famous in Taiwan for its Thai cuisine; Brasserie, a buffet restaurant at the Regent Hotel; and Hi-Lai Foods Inc.A few others, however, expressed worry that the new social distancing regulations will cripple their business, which is already sluggish due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Tofo Restaurant Group said that while it would do its best to comply with the CECC's guidelines, it feared that its revenue would drop by half in these difficult times.Nonetheless, Tofo Restaurant said, it would not resort to furloughs or salary cuts for its employees but rather would try to boost its online orders and take-out sales.As restaurants and beverage shops are expected to be among the hardest hit businesses in the country due to the coronavirus, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has allocated NT$265 million (US$8.75 million) in bailout funds for that sector, in the ministry's NT$20.491 billion economic relief package.The funds will be used primarily to help restaurants shift to e-commerce and delivery platforms, the MOEA said, adding that eligible restaurants and retailers can apply from April 10 to go digital.(By Flor Wang and Chiang Ming-yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004010021
04/1/2020,"In line with a recent announcement by Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), restaurants across Taiwan are starting to come on board with the concept of ‘social distancing’ albeit slowly.

Requirements to maintain a personal space of 1.5 metres from others when indoors have now seen at least two major domestic restaurant groups adopt new policies.

A number of others, however, have pushed back against the government’s latest effort to help stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Typically referring to potential loss of income should customers be forced to sit apart, those reluctant to follow the guidelines can apply for government help in shifting their services to delivery based operations from Friday, April 10th.

As part of a package aimed at helping those most affected by the pandemic the central government’s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) last month set aside NT $265 million for such purposes.

First issued on Tuesday before being expanded on Wednesday, the CECC guidelines also stated that restaurants or similar facilities should close their doors for a while should they not be able to follow the social distancing concept.

No penalties for non-compliance of the rules have yet been made public as far as can be ascertained.

Social distancing spacing in outdoor areas should be maintained at a distance of one metre according to the CECC.

Similar measures to bring social distancing to the fore are already in place at other places of business across Taiwan.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan has teamed up with Czechia in the fight against the coronavirus (COVID-19), which has infected nearly one million people worldwide and killed over 47,000 as of Thursday (April 2).

“To further strengthen consultation and cooperation on combatting the COVID-19 virus, both offices will seek to mediate and share best practices and cooperation,” stated a joint statement released by Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday (April 1). The statement was signed by Taiwan’s representative to the central European nation, Ke Liang-ruey (柯良叡), and the representative of the Czech Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei, Patrick Rumlar.

The Czech Republic is the first European country to reach a cooperative agreement with Taiwan on the epidemic. According to the joint statement, the collaboration will include the developments of test kits, vaccines, and medication in addition to research into health technology and information sharing for both countries’ virus response.

The central European nation has had a close relationship with Taiwan in the field of technology, according to Taiwanese authorities.

Based on findings from previous studies on the SARS epidemic, the NHRI — in collaboration with the National Defense Medical Center — discovered that SARS antigens could also be used to test for the coronavirus, reported CNA.

Similar to the method used to test for influenza, only a nasal swab is required to collect a secretion sample. The secretions are then placed in a test kit containing coronavirus antibodies, which will cling to the virus.

A change of color or the appearance of a visible line on the test strip indicates a positive result.

The nasal swab test would be less costly to produce than a nucleic acid test and could be widely used at clinics and hospitals for a quick diagnosis. This would contribute to early intervention and prompt quarantine measures before suspected patients’ symptoms get worse while reducing the risk of additional infections, NHRI Vice President Sytwu Huey-kang (司徒惠康) stated.

Compared to the Department of State, it is even closer to the U.S. president and deals with a broader range of issues,"" the former diplomat said.""In view of the trend, Taiwan's foreign service personnel may be able to establish direct communication with the NSC, aside from their direct communications with the State Department.""The tweet may also be interpreted as a signal to Beijing that discussions on Taiwan-U.S. affairs may be normalized and more direct in the future within the NSC, he said.He warned, however, that the furthering of Taiwan-U.S. relations may signal a tenser U.S.-China relationship in many fields, including military affairs, and Taiwan should beware of power struggles between the two giants.(By Chiang Chin-yeh, Emerson Lim and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/pc/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004030014

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Starting on April 4, Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations and buses in Taipei and New Taipei must refuse entry to passengers not wearing masks to protect against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), according to the Taipei City Government.

The city had initially proposed to launch the measure on April 9, when each Taiwanese resident will be allowed to buy nine masks once every two weeks, as there will be enough face masks to go around, CNA quoted Taipei City Deputy Mayor Huang Shan-shan (黃珊珊) as saying.

However, later in the day, the central government announced it would force all users of public transport to use masks, leading to Taipei City announcing its new measure would start Saturday (April 4).

The central government had already recommended that people keep a “social distance” of 1 meter outdoors and 1.5 m indoors, and when that is not possible, such as in the public transportation systems, then people should wear masks.

At the moment, citizens ae still lining up outside pharmacies to buy masks, which means that the supply is still not enough, but from April 9, everyone should have one mask per day, allowing passengers to wear one during their journey, Huang stated.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3909701

Agents from the Ministry of Justice and the National Immigration Agency intercepted them as they were about to board a flight out of Taoyuan Thursday (April 2).

The couple said they did not have the money to spend the rest of their time in Taiwan at a hotel, leading to the intervention of the South Korean office in Taipei. The two travelers were not expected to be allowed to leave Taiwan before they had paid the fine in full, according to the report.

04/3/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwanese and U.S. government officials held a telephone meeting to discuss ways to increase Taiwan’s international participation amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as the island nation has been consistently praised for successfully controlling the spread of the virus.

“The discussion focused on creating forums to share the successful and internationally lauded Taiwan Model on fighting COVID-19 with countries around the world,” said U.S. State Department’s spokesperson office via a statement on Friday (April 3). The meeting was attended by high-level officials representing the State Department, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), and representative offices of the two nations.

“Participants also discussed ongoing efforts to reinstate Taiwan’s observer status at the World Health Assembly, as well as other avenues for closer coordination between Taiwan and the World Health Organization,” according to the statement. “Countries around the world can benefit from better understanding the Taiwan Model as well as the generous contributions and impressive expertise from Taiwan,” it added.

Taiwan and the U.S. issued a joint statement last month on collaborating to combat the coronavirus, which has infected more than one million people worldwide and killed over 50,000 since it first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The deal involves research regarding test kits, vaccines, and medication for the coronavirus.

Under this project, Taiwan will donate 200,000 surgical masks to the U.S. on a weekly basis, and in return, the U.S. will provide materials that can be made into 300,000 pieces of protective clothing.

During a recent meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the State Department would do its best to assist Taiwan in playing a role in the world’s highest health policy-setting body. He added that the Department of State would comply with the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.

The act stipulates that the U.S. should work to strengthen Taiwan’s relations with its allies and expand Taiwan’s global standing. In addition, the American government should use its vote, voice, and influence to advocate Taiwan’s participation in international organizations as either a member or an observer.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the bilateral governmental meeting. “During the meeting, we shared an array of measures implemented in Taiwan to tackle the coronavirus,” it said in a statement.

Both parties also discussed possible ways to facilitate cooperation between Taiwan and countries sharing similar values and to promote Taiwan’s inclusion in the international community, the ministry added.

Participants in the meeting included U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs Pam Pryor, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Ambassador Atul Keshap, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Jonathan Fritz, Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Kelly Hsieh (謝武樵), and Taiwan’s Representative to the U.S. Stanley Kao (高碩泰).",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3909728
04/3/2020,"Taipei, April 3 (CNA) An article posted on a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has highlighted the early steps Taiwan took to contain the spread of the new coronavirus disease in the country, especially its coordination and use of information.""Of note, the centralized, real-time database of the country's national health insurance (NHI) helped support disease surveillance and case detection,"" said the essay, titled ""Policy Decisions and Use of Information Technology to Fight 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease, Taiwan.""The article, which appears on the U.S. CDC's ""Emerging Infectious Diseases"" journal and will be published in July, argued that the comprehensive response and innovative use of the NHI database by Taiwan's CDC effectively delayed and contained community transmission in Taiwan.That was accomplished even as the number of confirmed cases surged in neighboring countries in Asia starting in mid-February, said the article written by a research team that included members of Taiwan's CDC.The research team wrote that as soon as China reported an unidentified outbreak of 27 cases of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019, Taiwan assembled a task force and began doing quick health checks of passengers inside planes from Wuhan after they landed in Taiwan.Thanks to its rapid implementation of disease prevention measures, Taiwan detected and isolated the country's first coronavirus case on Jan. 20, it said, noting that laboratories in Taiwan developed 4-hour test kits and isolated two strains of the coronavirus before February.The adept use of the database was made possible, the team wrote, by adding people's travel histories to China and all confirmed and suspected case contacts to the NHI database.Those additions and the usual real-time NHI information on patients' health history ""helped pinpoint high-risk patients"" and gave the Taiwan CDC ""the ability to quickly identify new patterns of symptoms or clustered cases and the source or path of infection,"" the team said.Other factors leading to the effective response, the article said, were the experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak, prevalent public awareness, a robust public health network, support from health care industries, and cross-departmental collaborations.Despite its proximity to China, where the COVID-19 outbreak originated, Taiwan has reported a relatively low 348 confirmed cases with five deaths.Globally, the virus has so far infected over 1 million people in 188 countries, and more than 50,000 of them have died of the disease.The research team was led by Duke University professor Pikuei Tu (涂碧桂) and Taiwan CDC chief Chou Chih-hao (周志浩).The deputy director-general of the CDC, Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥), told CNA on Friday that Taiwan faced the infectious disease from China with extreme caution because of its geographic proximity to China and its painful experience in fighting SARS in 2003.""Different from some other countries, in which cities and states fought against the outbreak alone, Taiwan strengthened cross-departmental collaboration on quarantines,"" Chuang said.With the assistance of the police administration system, for example, local governments could quickly locate those who had contact with infected patients to stem the spread of the virus.(By Chang Ming-hsuan and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202004030013

In February, Tainan Community College disclosed the issue of stainless steel waste in corn farms throughout Houbi,Tainan. Investigators categorized three areas of a farm based on how well the corn grew and found the concentration of chromium was pegged as below 180 parts per million (ppm), 650 ppm and above 2000 ppm.

In some areas, the concentration even hit 3300 ppm, way above the average of 0.2 ppm found in Taiwan's farmlands.

However, the city's environmental bureau revealed in an article on March 23, that test results showed that the toxicity levels in the local soil, groundwater, and corn in the same area were all below the maximum limit. Tainan City Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) promised the land was safe to grow crops.

Hsieh He-lin (謝和霖), Secretary-General from Taiwan Watch Institue, pointed out that erroneous sampling procedures were the main reason for the contradictory test results. In fact, the primary soil had been mixed with the waste when people plowed the field, but the authorities only sampled the bottom layer of soil that was not contaminated, the Taiwan Environmental Information Association (TEIA) reported.

Although the environmental bureau explained that authorities had required the perpetrators to remove the waste and initiated the prosecution under the Agricultural Development Act. These actions, however, are seen as inefficient.

Lin argued that after the amendment of the Waste Disposal Act, stainless steel waste would no longer be categorized as a ""reusable product."" The authorities could simply demand landowners to remove the waste and even issue fines if necessary.

""If the Bureau does not execute the Waste Disposal Act but shifts the responsibility to local prosecutors, it is obvious inaction, a covering for illegal conduct,"" Lin declared.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3909787

04/4/2020,"EU urges government to halt executions

By Lin Chia-nan / Staff reporter





The EU yesterday called on Taiwan to refrain from using the death penalty, following the execution of murderer Weng Jen-hsien (翁仁賢) on Wednesday.

The Supreme Court on July 10 last year sentenced Weng, 53, to death after he was convicted of killing his parents, his niece, his nephew, his nephew’s wife and his parents’ caregiver in 2016.

Weng was executed in New Taipei City on Wednesday evening.

“The European Union condemns this crime in the strongest terms and expresses its sincere sympathy to the family of his victims,” the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan yesterday wrote on Facebook in English, relaying a statement from the EU Foreign Affairs Council.

“At the same time, the EU recalls its opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances. The EU believes that the death penalty is a cruel and inhumane punishment, which fails to act as a deterrent to crime and represents an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity,” it wrote.

“The European Union therefore calls on Taiwan to refrain from any future executions, to reinstate and maintain a de facto moratorium and to pursue a consistent policy towards the abolition of the death penalty in Taiwan,” it added.

Weng’s was the second execution carried out since President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) took office in May 2016, following the execution of death row inmate Lee Hung-chi (李宏基) in 2018.

The Ministry of Justice on Wednesday said in a news release that it understands there are different opinions about the death penalty, adding that it has been cautious about conducting executions before Taiwanese society reaches a consensus to abolish capital punishment.

The ministry said that it would continue communicating with advocates of abolishing or suspending the death penalty and working to strengthen social security and victim support networks, as well as educational initiatives on restorative justice, human rights and the rule of law, so that it might propose alternatives to capital punishment.

The Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty on Thursday said that it would withdraw from a ministry task force established in 2010 to research the gradual abolition of capital punishment, citing the ministry’s inaction on the issue.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/04/05/2003734040

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) thanked Japan and India Saturday (April 4) for helping 25 citizens leave India and Fiji amid the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

A total of 17 Taiwanese who had been stuck in India due to that country’s three-week lockdown had left and arrived in Taiwan on April 1, 3 and 4 with help from Japan, CNA reported. Another eight Taiwanese also succeeded in leaving the Pacific island state of Fiji with assistance from MOFA.

The evacuation from India occurred with help from the Japanese embassy there, which had asked Japanese airlines to allow Taiwanese citizens to take up empty seats. The Taiwanese took the flights to Tokyo and transited there to reach Taiwan, MOFA said.

Due to a recent extension of restrictions for foreign arrivals in Japan, Fiji Airways first canceled its flights to Tokyo, stranding the Taiwanese on the island. However, consultations between the three countries led to a resolution, with the airline organizing a special flight which carried the eight Taiwanese to Japan, according to MOFA.

He now works at the Camillian Saint Mary's Hospital in Yilan's Luodong Township.In 2017, Didone and his late brother Antonio were among six members of the Camillian Order to receive Taiwanese citizenship, in recognition of their contributions to Taiwanese society.(By Worthy Shen and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004050008

04/6/2020,"Taipei, April 6 (CNA) Taiwan-based smartphone vendor HTC Corp. saw revenues rise in March from the previous month after two straight months of declines, but the numbers were still well done from a year earlier.In a statement, HTC said it posted consolidated sales of NT$430 million (US$14.24 million) in March, up 3.1 percent from a month earlier, climbing out of a more than 10 percent fall in February.But the March number was still down 67.07 percent year-on-year.In February, HTC's consolidated sales dipped to NT$419 million, the lowest for the company in almost 20 years, down 12.34 percent from a month earlier and also down 32.96 percent from a year earlier.The rise in sales came after HTC unveiled new VR services for enterprise users for its Vive Pro Eye headset, which was introduced in early 2019, analysts said.The solutions, which enable enterprises to hold virtual meetings, saw rising demand from a business sector eager to avoid the spread of the new coronavirus disease, helping HTC generate higher sales in March, analysts said.In the first three months of this year, HTC's consolidated sales totaled NT$1.33 billion, down 54.83 percent from a year earlier, indicating that the company's core smartphone sales continue to tumble throughout its product range.Its VR operations continue to account for only a small fraction of HTC's total sales and have not been able to help offset the impact resulting from a sharp fall in smartphone shipments, analysts have said.HTC has said, however, that it will continue to invest in VR development by upgrading both its hardware and software offerings for the domestic and overseas markets.HTC announced in March that it was teaming up with eXtra, the largest consumer electronics gadget retailer in Saudi Arabia, to give Xtra Life VR park visitors the chance to experience VR applications.Saudi Arabia's first VR park is expected to attract about 360,000 visitors a year.The two companies are planning to open more Xtra Life VR parks in other countries in the Middle East.(By Jiang Ming-yan and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202004060018

After they gave the go-ahead, though asking for a few alterations, the supplier began producing it in bulk.""We have created around 500 boxes to be distributed to hospitals around Greater Jakarta,"" Christa said, with 100 of them already delivered on April 3.""Making the Aerosol Box is actually very new to our suppliers,"" but ""they are very eager and excited to make the boxes because it is for a good cause,"" she said.A key condition of Lai in sharing the design worldwide on Facebook last month was that it not be used for commercial purposes. In that spirit, the units are being given to the roughly 200 hospitals that have requested them so far for free.The first 250 boxes were funded by Christa's company through BLP Givesback, BLP Beauty's social corporate responsibility program.A crowdfunding campaign was then launched and raised about 100 million rupiah (NT$184,000, or US$6,080) to make the next batch of 250 units.The crowdfunding initiative will continue until April 17 to raise funds for additional demand, which has totaled 900 units to date, according to Christa.Lai's ""Aerosol Box"" is a transparent cube made of acrylic that covers a patient's head during endotracheal intubation, a necessary procedure for patients with COVID-19 who suffer respiratory failure.It has two holes on one side through which physicians can insert their arms to perform the procedure while being shielded from the patient's respiratory droplets and aerosol.The Indonesian version has been altered to accommodate the different doctors working on the front lines, said Christo Ekapatria, a physician at Siloam Hospitals in Tangerang who helped evaluate the box for local use.The circular cutouts of 10 centimeters in diameter were made larger to accommodate bigger doctors, and a third hole was added to one side of the box so that it can be used for intubation during surgeries.""Doctors need a hole to insert a cable or oxygen tube,"" Christo said. ""If the tube enters from the same holes, it will disturb doctors' maneuvers.""Designed as a makeshift response in an emergency when protective gear for medical professionals is lacking, the device has come in handy as more patients need to be intubated as the pandemic spreads and N95 masks are depleted.""When the first wave of COVID-19 came to Indonesia, we weren't ready, just like other countries.

04/7/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After Beijing mocked French scholars and politicians for supporting Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO), the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday (April 7) that the Chinese government should not prioritize politics before human lives.

In an appeal titled ""WHO must fully collaborate with Taiwan,"" which was published in the French news magazine L'Obs, more than 120 French parliamentarians and academics referred to Taiwan's management of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis as ""admirable."" They said the island nation deserved to be recognized for its efforts and admitted into the WHO.

The French signatories stressed that while Taiwan had done an exemplary job of containing the spread of the virus, it is still being excluded from the largest international health body. They added that Taiwan is currently the only country in the world that has centralized information gathering and decision-making within a cross-sector command: the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

The group urged the WHO to acknowledge Taiwan and allow it to join its meetings, asserting that the WHO needs Taiwan just as much as Taiwan needs the WHO.

On Monday (April 6), the Chinese representative office in France responded to the appeal by saying the statement exposed the signatories' lack of international knowledge. The office spokesman said it was laughable to suggest Taiwan should be recognized as a country when in reality, it is only a region of ""mother China,"" reported UDN.

Addressing China's comments during a press briefing Tuesday, MOFA spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) said the international community had started to notice Taiwan because of its successful coronavirus prevention and that China should cast politics aside amid the pandemic. She also expressed gratitude to the French group and promised that Taiwan will continue to share its experiences with the rest of the world, reported Liberty Times.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3911792

They said Chen kept parts of the victim's body as trophies.When the woman's family reported her as missing, police launched a search and listed Chen as the main suspect.

04/7/2020,"Taipei, April 7 (CNA) A Taiwanese research team has produced 25 human monoclonal antibodies based on antibody gene segments from three patients infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus.Huang Kuan-ying (黃冠穎), a resident physician at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital who led the research team, told the press Tuesday that the achievement could facilitate the development of not only rapid screening kits but also medication that targets the virus.Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immune system proteins that are created in the lab. They are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Like the body's own antibodies, mAbs recognize specific targets.The mAbs, made based on antibodies in B cells of the patients, are 13 strains targeting the spike protein (S) of the coronavirus and 12 strains targeting the nucleocapsid protein (N) of the virus.B cells are a type of white blood cell that make antibodies. They are part of the immune system and develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. They are also called B lymphocyte.Since the antibodies can identify the virus, they are useful in two areas, including the development and production of rapid testing agents, Huang said, and if such antibody testing agents react to tissue samples containing the virus, they can show the result in a minimum of 30 minutes.The other area in which they can be used is therapy, Huang went on, because mAbs are regarded as ""magic bullets"" that can cure some infectious diseases.His team found that there is one particular strain among the 13 S-targeting mAbs that has the ability to block the paths that the new coronavirus can use to invade the body, Huang said.He explained that for the virus to enter cells, it has to integrate with the cell receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, which is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells in organs.""The receptor is like a gate. If the virus outflanks an antibody to open it, the body will be infected,"" the researcher said. ""But if the antibody opens the gate first, it has the opportunity to stop the virus from entering cells.""Shih Shin-ru (施信如), a professor at the Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections of Chang Gung University, said this certain mAb, which was found capable of stopping the coronavirus from invading the body, can be used in the development of COVID-19 therapies or even vaccines if it is proven effective in human tests in the future.Compared with animal mAbs, those from humans will be safer to use in medical treatment, she added.(By Chen Wei-ting and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202004070017
04/8/2020,"Taiwan ought to face challenge of making senior citizens self-reliant and healthy (AP/Getty photo) Taiwan ought to face challenge of making senior citizens self-reliant and healthy (AP/Getty photo)

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After more than two months of upheaval, the world has now understood how transmissible and deadly the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is, especially for the elderly, who appear to be the most vulnerable amid this pandemic.

In the past weeks, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many developed countries. Italy, among the most hard hit, has demonstrated how disastrous things can be for an aged country unprepared for the lethal virus: 23 percent of its population are aged 65 or older, while 38 percent of its coronavirus cases are people more than 70 years old.

Although Taiwan's swift actions were able to effectively stem the spread of coronavirus, a similar virus scenario decades later would result in a completely different outcome. By 2065, 41.2 percent of Taiwan's population would be above 65 years old.

A future virus outbreak would result in medical staff overwhelmed by a wave of elderly infections.

Since the increase of elderly people is an inevitable trend, Taiwan ought to have robust seniors who are resilient to diseases and able to continue contributing to the country despite their age.

""Nations around the world are redefining the meaning of old people,"" said Chen Liang-kung (陳亮恭), Geriatrician at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. He believes as people live longer and healthier, using the age of 65 to define the retirement age and categorize people into a group that needs to be taken care of, loses its footing.

Chen believes the key to alleviating the burden the aging population puts on the health care system is to shift the goal of health care. Taiwan's geriatrics should work to prevent the elderly from developing disabilities, such as malfunctioned organs or mobility issues, rather than merely curing their illnesses.

A disease's influence tends to be underestimated: diabetes might shorten a patient's life for two years but will cause him eight years of kidney dialysis before he passes away. In total, the disease places eight years of disability and strain on the health care system.

""According to clinical experience, we know that many chronic diseases will just occur as people age, but we can decide when it will happen and minimize the time of disability and dementia that seniors might suffer,"" Chen argued. This approach means people can actually systematically free up capacity of the health care system.

Chronic diseases also cast a vast demand for personal care. In 2019, more than 260,000 foreign personal care workers supported Taiwanese households by taking care of the elderly and disabled. If another devastating pandemic were to reach Taiwan, these care takers would be unable to tend to the tens of thousands of elderly across the country.

Chen pointed out that rethinking how medical services function would be the first step to more efficient hospitals: many medical facilities have implemented integrated outpatient services to provide one-stop clinics for patients with multiple chronic diseases. These services allow doctors to provide holistic, informed medical advice to patients to make sure their ailments would not deprive them from remaining self-reliant.

In addition, this new measure could preserve more medical resources as the Taiwanese elderly can visit clinics up to 30 times per year on average, according to Chen.

A virus can be an equalizer for all age groups in a pandemic. However, a country replete with healthy elders means it has spare resources when an unprecedented disease catches people off guard; it is especially crucial for a populated island nation in which an aging population and shrinking workforce are becoming an inevitable reality.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3911925

04/8/2020,"Taipei, April 8 (CNA) A technical cooperation effort between Taiwan and Denmark has produced a testing device for the COVID-19 coronavirus that shows the results in just 12 minutes, but it is still in the clinical trial stage, Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology announced Wednesday.The device, dubbed ViroTrack COVID-19 IgM/IgG, was developed by a joint startup BluSense Diagnostics, with funding from Taiwan, the ministry said while unveiling the test kit at a press event.All it requires is one drop of blood (30 ul) from the patient, and the ViroTrack can produce a result within 12 minutes, indicating whether the person is carrying the virus or has recovered from a COVID-19 infection, the ministry said.In an initial clinical trial last week, 15 blood samples were tested at Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark, and performance of the device was 90 percent in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, according to BluSense Diagnostics.Further clinical trials will be conducted next week at Italian hospitals, with the aim of obtaining certification in the European Union in May and releasing the device on the Taiwan market by June, the company said.ViroTrack is portable and easy to use, which makes it suitable for COVID-19 screening at ports of entry, Deputy Science and Technology Minister Shieh Dar-bin (謝達斌) said at the press event, adding that he hopes it can be supplied to countries that have limited testing capacity.The device will be also be valuable in contact tracing in communities to identify asymptomatic patients, according to BluSense Executive Vice President Jessie Sun (孫偉芸).ViroTrack works by checking the human antibodies immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to determine the stage of infection, according to BluSense Diagnostics Chairman Filippo Bosco.IgM is the largest human antibody and usually the first to appear in the response to initial exposure to an antigen, while IgG is the most prolific and acts as protection against bacterial and viral infection.In COVID-19 cases, IgM appears around the 4th day of the infection, which means it can indicate suspected cases, while IgG shows up on the 10th day or later, giving an indication of whether the patient has been infected or is recovering, Bosco said.With the help of those indicators, medical professionals can determine whether a patient has recovered and can be discharged from the hospital, which is much more efficient than the current polymerise chain reaction (PCR)-based tests, he said.At present, PCR and antibody testing are the main forms of COVID-19 testing globally, while ViroTrack uses blood serum, according to Shieh.BluSense Diagnostics, a startup jointly funded by Taiwan and Denmark, has its biochemical research base in Copenhagen and its hardware and software development and research center, as well as a manufacturing plant, in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan.(By Su Ssu-yun and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202004080025
04/8/2020,"Taipei, April 8 (CNA) Taiwan's government has decided to requisition 3 million N95 masks per month - the country's total monthly output - to ensure a stable supply for medical workers amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.On average, medical workers in Taiwan use 30,000 to 40,000 N95 masks a day, and there are no worries at present about a shortage of supply, the MOEA official, who declined to be named, told CNA.Nonetheless, the government is still requisitioning the masks -- 1.5 million every two weeks -- based on advice from Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure the safety of medical personnel, the official said.The official did not offer any further explanation of why the CDC felt it necessary to requestion Taiwan's total domestic N95 mask capacity given that domestic demand has fallen far short of that.The four companies in Taiwan capable of producing N95 masks have a combined capacity of 100,000 to 105,000 per day, the official said.That capacity will go up by about 20,000 N95 masks a day when one of the four producers adds new production lines by the end of April, according to the official.The government first requisitioned N95 masks, which can filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles and are mainly used by medical workers on the front lines, on Feb. 6, according to a local mask supplier, and planned to requisition 2.1 million of them from Feb. 17 to March 17.The N95 masks are much more time-consuming to make than the regular medical-grade face masks that are widely used by most workers and residents to combat the spread of the virus.Economic Affairs Minister Shen Jong-chin (沈榮津) told reporters on Monday that N95 masks require four times the amount of melt-blown non-woven fabric that are needed for a standard medical-grade mask, of which Taiwan now produces 15 million a day.Though enough of the raw material exists to produce both types of masks in their current quantities, Shen said the ministry would adjust the output of the masks in the future based on the progression of the epidemic should the demand for N95 masks or regular surgical masks rise sharply.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004080017

04/8/2020,"Taipei, April 8 (CNA) Lawyers representing Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) on Wednesday filed an administrative litigation, seeking the court's review of whether a recall vote against him should be allowed to proceed.In the filing, Han's legal team said the groups that initiated the petition to recall him contravened the relevant law during the signature drive, which on Tuesday reached the threshold to allow a recall vote in June.The groups began collecting signatures long before Han had been in office for one year, which contravened Article 75 of the Civil Servants Election and Recall Act, Han's lawyer Yeh Ching-yuan (葉慶元) and former Kaohsiung city spokesman Anne Wang (王淺秋) said.Wang further argued that a recall vote, which is expected to cost NT$110 million (US$ 3.65 million), would be a waste of taxpayers' money and would also be a risky exercise at this time during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The legal team, therefore, filed an administrative litigation in the Taipei High Administrative Court and at the Executive Yuan, seeking a review of the Central Election Commission's right to proceed with a recall vote against Han, despite the success of the petition in obtaining the required number of signatures.The Central Election Commission (CEC) declined to comment on the move by Han's lawyers, saying only that it will hold a committee meeting on April 17 to verify the signatures on the petition.Meanwhile, one of the leaders of the recall movement Aaron Yin (尹立) said Han's lawyers apparently had misinterpreted the law. The Civil Servants Election and Recall Act states that a recall proposal can only be filed against a civil servant who has been in office for more than one year, but it does not prevent the collection of signatures beforehand, Yin said.He said his organization, WeCare Kaohsiung, put forth the recall proposal on June 27, 2019, after Han announced his presidential bid less than six months into his mayoral term, angering many Kaohsiung citizens who thought he was not giving priority to running the city.Han, the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate in the Jan. 11 presidential election, lost to the incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) by a margin of more than 19 percent.When the recall petition was launched against Han last year, the KMT said it was politically motivated, and the party drew attention to the fact that Yin had served as head of the Kaohsiung City Cultural Affairs Bureau from 2016-2018 under former Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu (陳菊) of the DPP.Under Taiwan law, once the CEC confirms the required number of signatures and verifies them in what is now the second stage of process, a recall vote must be held within 60 days.In order for the result to be valid, at least 25 percent of voters -- about 580,000 in Kaohsiung - must participate in the recall vote, and a recall becomes valid if a majority votes in favor of it.On Tuesday, the Kaohsiung City election commission announced that the petition to recall Han has passed the required threshold in the second stage of the three-step recall process.Under the Civil Servants Election and Recall Act, the first stage in the recall process is to submit a proposal containing the signatures of 1 percent of the constituency's eligible voters.In the case of Kaohsiung with an estimated 2.28 million eligible voters, that means 22,800 signatures, which the recall groups collected and passed on to the CEC for review on Jan. 17.In the second stage, the recall initiators had 60 days to collect the signatures of at least 10 percent of the eligible voters in Kaohsiung, or around 228,000 people.The signatures collected in the first phase are not considered valid in that stage of the process. The recall initiators ultimately collected more than 550,000 signatures in 40 days and sent around 400,000 to the city's election commission for verification on March 7.(By Lin Chang-shuan, Wang Cheng-chung and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004080015

04/9/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved Google's plan to use a U.S.-Taiwan undersea telecommunications cable on Wednesday (April 9), but banned the section between the U.S. and Hong Kong.

U.S. authorities allowed Google to operate a portion of the 8,000-mile (12874.75 kilometers) Pacific Light Cable Network System (PLCN) between the U.S and Taiwan after blocking its previous plan that included the maintenance of the U.S.-Hong Kong route.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) told the FCC it believed, “there is a significant risk that the grant of a direct cable connection between the United States and Hong Kong would seriously jeopardize the national security and law enforcement interests of the United States,” Reuters reported.

According to the news outlet, Google and Facebook had helped pay for construction of the now completed telecommunications link but never received approval from U.S. authorities to use it. The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, trade war, and security concerns between the U.S. and China made the cable connection to Hong Kong a controversial decision.

The partial approval from the FCC came after Google's warning that it may have to seek alternative cable options at drastically higher prices if the agency blocked the whole plan.

The search engine giant admitted it had to meet internal demand for data transmission between the U.S and Taiwan, especially to connect Google's Taiwan data center with its counterparts in America and to serve users throughout the Asia-Pacific region.

During a press conference at the United Nations health agency’s headquarters in Geneva on Wednesday (April 8), WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus took aim at Taiwan. He claimed to have received racist remarks and death threats, attributing the attacks to Taiwanese.

“And Taiwan, the foreign ministry also, they know the campaign. They didn’t disassociate themselves. They even started criticizing me in the middle of all that insult and slur, but I didn’t care,” said Tedros, who had been asked to comment on U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of the organization.

Tedros’ accusations spurred a public outcry on social media and drew protests from the Taiwan authorities. The fundraising campaign was started on Friday (April 10) in the hope of financing a full-page advertisement that will appear in The New York Times next Monday (April 13).

Tedros’ accusations are “a piece of appalling and world-class fake news,” said campaigners on the fundraising page. Media and people around the world watching the press conference could be misled by Tedros’s statement and thus misunderstand Taiwan, they added.

The advertisement will contain a firm rebuttal of Tedros’ claims, in addition to messages that urge international organizations to include Taiwan. In recent years, Taiwan has met with increasing difficulty to take part in the WHO, International Civil Aviation Organization, or Interpol activities, as Beijing ramps up pressure on those international organizations.

“We condemn acts of discrimination, and we extend our respect toward those who have experienced bully, discrimination, negligence, and indifference,” said the campaigners. “Taiwan itself has long suffered similar treatment in the international community,” they added.

The fundraising campaign was initiated by a group of Taiwan's independent media companies, YouTubers, and designers who refer to themselves as #ThisAttackComesFromTaiwan. The hashtag has been used by Taiwanese netizens who began bombarding Twitter and Facebook with photos of Taiwan cuisine and landscapes as a response to Tedros’ claim that Taiwanese had been attacking him.

The campaign aims to garner NT$4 million (US$131,880) within 18 hours. It had received 20 percent backing as of press time.

“I strongly protest the accusations today that Taiwan is instigating racist attacks in the international community,” said Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) on Thursday (April 9). “For years, we have been excluded from international organizations, and we know better than anyone else what it feels like to be discriminated against and isolated,” said the incumbent president, who went on to say the country remains committed to making contributions to the international community.

“@DrTedros said there's ""No need to use #COVID19 to score political points. We agree! Yet without evidence, #Taiwan is accused of orchestrating personal attacks,” said Taiwan' foreign minister via Twitter. “[Tedros'] claim is baseless, without merit & further marginalizes the good work in which the @WHO is engaged worldwide.”",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3913992

Oh, to be the other “Tiger” on Netflix.

Alan Yang's “Tigertail” is either blessed to arrive in the stormy wake of “Tiger King,"" or doomed to be the other “Tiger” title Netflix users accidentally select when they're looking for the tabloid story of a zoo owner, not a patient and personal immigrant tale.

Yang's film, he has said, sprang from both the upbringing of his Taiwanese father and his own imagination. It's a gentle and pensive intergenerational story about love and leaving home, about how an immigrant father's experiences might not be as distant from his first-generation daughter's as he imagines.

“Tigertail,” which debuts on Netflix on Friday, is the directorial debut of Yang, a writer-producer on “Parks & Recreation” and a co-creator of “Master of None."" On the latter, with Aziz Ansari, Yang often stretched sitcom-like comedy in unpredictable arthouse directions.

In “Tigertail,” he has dispensed with the comic set-up and gone straight for the arthouse, striving for the kind of lyricism of Wong Kar-wai or the elliptical beauty of Hou Hsiao-Hsien. Yang's film, heartfelt but inert, only briefly touches on anything like the work of those filmmakers. But it's an earnest stab at a drifting kind of memory piece that crosses generational divides, from Taiwan to New York.

The movie's most vibrant images come early. It opens on a young boy running through shining rice fields in rural Taiwan. The boy, Pin-Jui (Tzi Ma), grows up to be a factory worker. He reconnects with a girl he met in those fields, who becomes his first love. Their scenes together, dancing, are handsome. But when Pin-Jui is given the opportunity to go to America, it comes with the bargain of an arranged marriage, to a woman named Zhenzhen (Fiona Fu).

These scenes are overlaid with contemporary ones of an older Pin-Jui and his grown daughter, Angela (Christine Ko). She is navigating her own heartbreak but finds her stoic father indifferent to her pain. His reflections of his past play out as a withheld history that, if he relents, could bond them.

“Tigertail” comes off more as an idea of an arthouse movie than one propelled by its own volition. While the 1960s-set scenes have a warm glow, the modern-day ones are flat. We've been blessed lately with films that chronicle multi-generational tales, straddling Asia and America, like last year's “The Farewell” (in which Ma also co-starred) and the upcoming Sundance winner “Minari.” “Tigertail” doesn't rise to the level of those movies, but it contributes to a heartening trend.

“Tigertail,"" a Netflix release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for some thematic elements, language, smoking and brief sensuality. Running time: 91 minutes. Two stars out of four.

She tested positive for the coronavirus on April 8, CECC records showed.Meanwhile, a COVID-19 patient in his 70s died Thursday, the CECC said.The man, who suffered from underlying conditions, was part of a tour group that visited Egypt from March 3-12, the CECC records showed.He started displaying symptoms on March 17 and was confirmed positive on March 19, the CECC said.The man's condition started to deteriorate on March 20 when he suffered breathing difficulties and was transferred to the intensive care unit, the CECC said, adding that he passed away April 9.Ninety-one of Taiwan's COVID-19 patients have been released from quarantine, while six have died.

At a news conference on Wednesday, MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Head, Baushuan Ger (葛葆萱), said that Taiwan will be donating over 1 million surgical masks to NSP countries. Ger said that although there are 18 NSP countries, Taiwan is currently only preparing to donate face masks to those countries which have informed them of a need.

When asked how many countries have requested masks, Ger estimated there are ""seven or eight"" thus far. A source familiar with the matter told CNA that seven of the countries to have requested masks include the Philippines, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Singapore.

Ger said the total number of masks allotted to NSP countries will surpass 1 million, but he did not specify how many would be distributed to each country. In addition, Taiwan will be sending 1 million masks to its 15 diplomatic allies, 2 million to the U.S., and 7 million to 11 European countries.

Singapore is suddenly facing an increased need for face masks as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on April 3 stated the government will ""no longer discourage people from wearing masks,"" reported The Online Citizen. Lee said the policy change had been made as more evidence had been gathered about the ability of asymptomatic patients to transmit the disease.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – If the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic lasts beyond the summer, Taiwan could find it hard to see its economy grow by even just 1 percent, business leaders said Friday (April 10).

Most forecasts from before the pandemic saw Taiwan’s Gross Domestic Product expand by at least 2 percent during 2020, though as the virus started affecting more countries, economists and institutes started adjusting the figure downward to just above or under 2 percent.

Speaking in Taipei Friday, General Chamber of Commerce (全國商業總會) Chairman Lai Cheng-yi (賴正鎰) said that original expectations had been that the pandemic could be brought under control by the end of March. In that event, Taiwan’s GDP growth would have ranged from 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent. However, that was not the case, with the number of deaths growing rapidly around the world, CNA quoted the businessman as saying.

If the pandemic lasts beyond the summer until the end of the year, Taiwan’s economy would find it hard to grow even by just 1 percent, according to Lai. One of the main reasons would be that demand in the United States and Europe would remain weak because of the ravages caused by the coronavirus, leaving Taiwan with shrinking markets for its exports.

At present, several sectors of the Taiwanese economy are suffering, with restaurants seeing their business drop by more than 80 percent, hotels by 75 percent, and launderettes by at least half, according to Lai.

While the government has launched a package worth more than NT$1 trillion (US$33.28 billion) to support the economy, the business leaders said it might be enough to help enterprises extend their life but not to fuel a real revival.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3913951

It read:""News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, CHINA. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were believed not SARS; however the samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment. I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us. Thank you very much in advance for your attention to this matter.""Chen, who is also head of Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), argued that while Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control did not actually mention ""human-to-human"" transmissions in the email, it had ""strongly hinted"" at the possibility.He said the letter clearly indicated that health authorities in China confirmed seven patients with atypical pneumonia had been isolated for treatment.""If being isolated for treatment is not a warning, what situation will constitute a warning?"" Chen said.Chen also asked whether China, as a WHO member, informed the world health body of the seven cases.If the Chinese did not notify the WHO, ""what else would be called a cover up?"" he asked. ""If (the Chinese) did report it, what else would be deemed a dereliction of duty (on the part of the WHO)?""In repeated statements to international and local media, as well as at news conferences, Taiwan's officials, including from the health and foreign ministry, had said it warned WHO of the possibility of human-to-human transmission in the email it sent to the WHO on Dec. 31, when the COVID-19 outbreak first came to public knowledge.On Friday, international media, including the Agence France-Presse, a news agency based in Paris, reported that the WHO denied Taiwan's claim that it mentioned the possibility of human-to-human transmission in its email.Responding to this, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) accused the WHO of ""garbling the email content"" in a phone interview with CNA Friday night.Chuang said Taiwan learned about the emergence of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan on Dec. 31, 2019, which was later known as COVID-19, and immediately alerted the WHO and the Chinese side through email, requesting them to verify.Atypical pneumonia is what China commonly referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Chuang said, stressing that the disease itself, also caused by coronavirus, is transmittable from human to human.Although Taiwan did not ""directly"" point out the possibility for human-to-human transmission in that email due to confused information at that time, its email ""strongly hinted"" of such a scenario based on the characteristics of SARS and observations that patients in China were isolated, Chuang said.In a press conference held on March 24, CECC officials claimed that the WHO failed to pass on its warning in the Dec. 31 email about a possible human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus to other countries.Taiwan's claims of its early warning has led to a diplomatic row between the United States and China, and fueled Washington's criticism of the WHO.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus supported Taiwan's claim in a recent Twitter post and blamed Chinese authorities' refusal to admit human-human transmission until Jan. 20 for the ""catastrophic consequences"" of COVID-19.A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman and other Chinese spokespersons have rejected such claims, arguing that China had taken effective and strong measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down the entire Hubei province of 58 million people, where the outbreak was first discovered.The WHO's website states that on Dec. 31, WHO's China office was informed of several cases of unknown pneumonia, and by Jan. 3, Chinese authorities had informed the WHO of 44 cases: https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/U.S. officials and others have also criticized the WHO for saying there was only limited human-to-human transmission as late as Jan. 14 and not announcing the virus could be transmitted from person to person until 10 days later.The WHO, however, has argued that it actively dealt with the outbreak, getting information from China and seeking details on its own, while also passing on findings to the global community.Meanwhile, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA）reiterated on Saturday that Taiwan's tightening of virus preventive measures, including the screening on airline passengers from China right after the email was sent, was indeed implemented based on the assessment that the emerging disease was transmittable between humans.The MOFA reiterated that Taiwan, as a member of the international community, has the ability and the willingness to cooperate with international partners in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus and to contribute to the health and welfare of all mankind.The U.S., Taiwan and the WHO, including its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have been locked in a word war on the accountability of the spread of the coronavirus and Taiwan's participation in the WHO.Taiwan is not a member of the WHO because of China's objections and it lost its observer status in the WHO's World Health Assembly in the past few years due to tense relations between the current administration and Beijing.Taiwanese officials have argued that its exclusion means it cannot easily obtain information from or share its expertise with the WHO about disease outbreaks or other health issues.(By Chang Ming-hsuan and Emerson Lim) Enditem/cs",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004110004

The motion comes as Taiwan and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus are embroiled in a war of words over allegations by the latter that the island nation's criticism of his handling of the virus was racially motivated. His comments touched off a wave of indignation in Taiwan, launching sarcasm-laced attacks and a fundraising campaign for a New York Times ad.

MOFA said Saturday that 67 members of the European Parliament from across the political spectrum had signed a letter to Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, on April 8, while 60 members of the German Bundestag had sent a letter to Adhanom on April 2. In both cases, the politicians praised Taiwan’s performance in the fight against the coronavirus and said its exclusion from the WHO amounts to unfair discrimination, CNA reported.

Taiwan should be invited to the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) scheduled for May in Geneva, Switzerland, according to the signatories. The Bundestag member behind the German petition, of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU, said Taiwan’s exclusion is incomprehensible and should end, as it is a matter of life and death.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3914545

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A fundraising campaign to place an ad in The New York Times responding to accusations leveled at Taiwan by the World Health Organization (WHO) chief had already collected NT$10.28 million (US$342,000) by Saturday noon (April 11), or more than double its target of NT$4 million.

The campaign emerged after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a news conference on March 8 accused Taiwan of personal attacks and “racism,” comments which set off a storm of indignation on the island. Tedros has been criticized for helping China downplay the seriousness of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and not just by Taiwan.

The plan for their open letter was to collect NT$4 million within eight hours after Friday’s 1:30 p.m. launch, but they reached their target by 10 p.m., CNA reported. By Saturday morning, the total stood at NT$10.28 million.

In a reaction to the campaign’s overwhelming success, Du said that due to the limitations the coronavirus pandemic might impose on the distribution of newspapers, they were considering paying for an online ad instead.

04/11/2020,"Taipei, April 11 (CNA) The first-quarter sales of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, exceeded its earlier guidance, mainly on record high revenues for March.The strong first-quarter sales reflected solid global demand for 5G applications and high performance computing (HPC) devices, which has offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the typical slow season effects, according to market analysts.In a statement released Friday, TSMC posted about NT$310.60 billion (US$10.32 billion) in consolidated sales for the January-March period, up 42 percent from a year earlier but down 2.09 percent from the previous quarter.The company's first-quarter sales beat its estimate of NT$304.98 billion to NT$307.97 billion, which was made at an investor conference in mid-January.In March alone, TSMC's consolidated sales totaled NT$113.52 billion, a new monthly record that was up 21.5 percent from the previous month and 42.4 percent from a year earlier.In addition to the strong demand for 5G and HPC devices, an increase in the number of working days in March also helped generate the record high sales, analysts said.TSMC has scheduled an investor conference for April 16 to detail its first-quarter results and give sales guidance for the second quarter. With the COVID-19 pandemic showing no immediate signs of easing, investors are expected to ask the company for further assessments of negative effects on the global semiconductor industry down the road.Gartner and IC Insights, two global market information providers, have warned that sales in the global semiconductor industry will drop this year due to the pandemic, with the former predicting an annual 0.9 percent decline and the latter forecasting a 4 percent decrease.According to analysts, pure wafer foundry operators, including TSMC, are unlikely to meet an earlier combined annual sales growth target of over 17 percent in 2020, due to the coronavirus.At TSMC's upcoming investor conference, it is also expected to announce whether its capacity expenditure budget for 2020 will remain at between US$15 billion and US$16 billion.Earlier this week, TSMC announced plans to raise NT$21.6 billion by selling unsecured company bonds to finance the construction of a new production site and expansion of its production capacity, after a bond sale of NT$21.4 billion in March.Analysts said the proceeds from the new bond sale will be used to finance TSMC's efforts to develop advanced 5 and 3 nanometer processes at its plants in the Southern Taiwan Science Park.The company is set to launch mass production of 5nm chips in the first half of this year and 3nm chips in 2022.

04/12/2020,"Taipei, April 12 (CNA) Media visibility and direct messaging could be the motives behind the frequent appearances of Chinese and American military assets near Taiwan, especially as they are both struggling with the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, according to analysts in Taiwan.Between January 23 and April 10, Chinese military aircraft were spotted at least six times flying near Taiwan's airspace, according to the records of Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) and military air movement tracker Aircraft Spots.On Sunday morning, Chinese aircraft carrier the Liaoning passed the Miyako Strait south of Japan and was about to sail into waters east of Taiwan on its way to the South China Sea.Meanwhile, since March 25, U.S. military aircraft and vessels have been seen at least nine times near Taiwan.Lin Ying-yu (林穎佑), an assistant professor at National Chung Cheng University's Institute of Strategic and International Affairs, told CNA on Saturday that the presence of American and Chinese military assets in the area was an indication of increased propaganda efforts by both countries and more frequent flexing of their muscles to boost morale at home, as they have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.He noted that a Chinese military helicopter crashed in Hong Kong on March 30, less than a month after a military plane crashed in China, which he said raised the question of whether the capabilities of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) had been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.In contrast, Taiwan has been gaining international visibility as a result of its relatively successful COVID-19 control measures and donations of personal protective equipment to other countries, Lin said.This may have forced Beijing to think about some action to warn Taiwan against ""taking advantage of the pandemic"" to move toward independence, he said.Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), senior analyst at the Institute of National Defense and Security Research, said China has expanded its maritime and air presence in the Indo-Pacific region through actions such as aiming missiles at U.S. military facilities in the region and militarizing civilian fishing boats to challenge government vessels from Taiwan and Japan.The U.S. has responded by increasing the presence of its military aircraft and warships in the region, Su said.He said it is worth noting that the U.S. has been responding more frequently and readily to the PLA's movements in the area and has been engaging in ""military public diplomacy"" via social media to convey its message directly to the public.However, Chieh Chung (揭仲), research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight, thinks that that an accidental military encounter between the two giants is unlikely.They both seem to be deliberately staggering their military maneuvers in the region, Chieh said. They follow rules agreed upon, and communications between their high-level military officials and decision-makers seemed unimpeded somehow, he said.""In light of those factors, while there is a possibility of such a scenario, it is within a controllable level,"" Chieh said.(By Chen Yun-yu and Emerson Lim) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004120012

The season opener in Taiwan has attracted heavy international media attention, as all the world’s sporting events have come to a halt during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In order to evacuate nationals stranded in China's Hubei province due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the Taiwanese government arranged flights for them through China Airlines on March 29 and 30. The first batch of 153 passengers was released Monday morning after spending two weeks in quarantine, reported CNA.

The quarantine site, located between New Taipei and Taoyuan, had been planning for a stream of vehicles since early morning, hoping to successfully transport the newly released patients back to their homes. Meanwhile, police conducted security checks and directed traffic in the surrounding area.

Many of the patients' family members arrived at the quarantine site before 5 a.m.

Each person had their temperature checked and underwent disinfection at a checkpoint before being released. At 6:00 a.m., many were picked up by their families, while others took buses to the Taoyuan High Speed Rail (HSR) Station or the Taoyuan Airport MRT line to get home.

“It was an easy ordeal,” according to Wu (吳), an evacuee who had been China for nearly three months and locked down in Hubei for more than 70 days.

Wu, who had already bought a house in Hubei, explained that he had been visiting relatives with his wife on Jan. 15 and that he had not expected to stay for so long.

After Taiwan had announced the two flights, many people hired cars and traveled from Hubei to Shanghai in order to board the flight home. The taxi fare alone cost nearly RMB$1,500 (USD$212.73) per person.

After returning to Taiwan, he was placed under quarantine for 14 days. Wu stated that the meals provided at the quarantine site were very lavish and that the staff members were all extremely nice.

“Even if you can’t eat because of physical discomfort,” he said, “the staff will still give you some bread or instant noodles at night.”

As his son, who was also held up in China, was about to take the college entrance examination, the two of them hurried back to Taiwan first. Wu’s wife, who has not yet obtained a Taiwanese identity card, stayed in Hubei but said that ""Taiwan is the safest place in the world.""

04/13/2020,"Taipei, April 13 (CNA) Taiwan will extend its ban on exports of surgical masks and continue its requisition of factories that produce surgical masks until the end of June, from the original deadline of April 30, the health minister announced Monday.The current ban on exports of other protective items, such as protective and isolation gowns, could be eased, however, so that manufacturers can sell their products abroad, said Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), at a daily press briefing.Chen, however, did not elaborate as to when the ban on exports of protective garments will be eased.Taiwan stopped exports of all surgical masks on Jan. 24, three days after it confirmed the first case of COVID-19 infection and domestic demand surged.One week later on Jan. 31, Taiwan requisitioned all factories able to produce face masks so that it could control the distribution and output of masks, as panic buying emerged after more cases of the new coronavirus infection were reported in the nation.From Feb. 6, a rationing system was launched, with each person in Taiwan, no matter whether they are locals or foreign nationals, allowed to buy three masks per week at a price of NT$5 each at pharmacies, using their National Health Insurance cards or other forms of ID.The rationing was not eased until April 9, when the number of rationed masks was increased to 9 pieces every two weeks, after mask output was significantly increased to 15 million per day from the 1.88 million before the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to government data.Meanwhile, after inaugurating three vending machines selling surgical masks two days earlier, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) said he plans to install more such machines in all 12 administrative districts of the city next week as an alternative option through which citizens can purchase masks.At present, the purchase of rationed masks can only be made online or in person at pharmacies.In normal circumstances, each vending machine can sell 60 packages of adult masks (nine pieces each) per hour, according to Ko, meaning that the three machines currently running on a trial basis in the Xinyi District Health Center near Taipei 101 can sell 180 packages per hour.Each day the machines can sell up to 1,800 packages in total, said Ko, who added that the vending machines will be an additional option that could help disperse the long queues of buyers outside pharmacies.(By Chen Wei-ting and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004130017
04/13/2020,"Taipei, April 13 (CNA) Singapore's first lady on Monday updated a social media post, expressing gratitude for Taiwan's planned donation of surgical face masks to the city-state after a previous post expressing apparent reservations over the offer triggered controversy online over the weekend.In the original post published Saturday, Ho Ching (何晶), the wife of Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (李顯龍), shared a link to an English-language news story on the Taiwan News website on April 10, which was headed ""Taiwan to donate medical masks to Singapore.""Under the link, Ho posted a cryptic comment, ""Errrr…"", which seemed to indicate she was not keen on the idea.In other comments under the post, some Singaporeans said Ho's apparent lack of enthusiasm over the donation was because of Taiwan's current ban on the export of surgical face masks, which impacted the mask supply to Singapore, as the country had two surgical mask production lines in Taiwan.The post drew emotional responses from Taiwanese and Singaporean netizens who traded barbs over the issue.In an attempt to stop the controversy, Ho updated the post on Monday, thanking Taiwan for its offer of help.""To all our friends and friends of friends in Taiwan, a huge thank you to all that you have done, and please know that I'm forever grateful,"" Ho said in the post.""We all know we are in this together as one world -- and I'm totally grateful for every one which has reached out, advised, pointed the way, and tried their best to help, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.""Ho also said ""mistakes"" are also forgiven, without further elaborating.She called on netizens to calm their heated debate while asking people to work together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.""It's the covid that we should beat, not one by one, not country by country, not flag by flag, because the little bug doesn't respect any of our prejudices and biases, hopes or fears,""she added.When asked to comment on Ho's updated post, Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) said she has no further comment other than reiterating the long-standing friendship between the two countries, which will continue to be enhanced.The ministry said a day earlier that discussions on a donation of surgical face masks to Singapore are still in progress and the ""personal views of an individual"" will not affect ongoing talks.The government imposed an export ban from Jan. 24 to the end of June, saying it was part of the country's efforts to ensure the steady domestic supply of masks during the COVID-19 outbreak.Meanwhile, Taiwan's Finance Minister Su Jain-rong (蘇建榮) said Monday that before the ban took effect, Singaporean mask manufacturer ST Engineering was given permission by Taiwan's government to send the N95 face masks it produced that were already packed for export back to Singapore.That batch of N95 masks cleared Taiwan customs on Jan. 29, Su said.The mask production equipment owned by the Singaporean company was shipped back to Singapore on Feb. 12, he added.Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said the N95 masks ST Engineering made in Taiwan were not certified as medical-use masks so the country did not confiscate them.Asked to comment on the issue, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) head, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) called for such online debate over Ho's post to stop, while admitting that the face mask ban did affect Singapore's face mask production for a short period of time.Taiwan's government did its best to facilitate the mask production equipment being sent back to Singapore as soon as possible, he said.As Singapore is experiencing a hike in COVID-19 cases, Taiwan is offering to donate surgical masks to the city-state because ""friends should help each other,"" he added.Taiwan has been making donations of surgical masks to countries hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the United States and 11 European countries, as well as to its 15 diplomatic allies, after the country's daily surgical mask output reached 13 million earlier this month, more than four times its production level in early February, according to the government.On April 9, Taiwan said it will also donate masks to some of the countries listed in its New Southbound Policy, which covers Australia, New Zealand, and 18 countries in Southeast and South Asia.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004130014

They don't have the experience of Taiwan,"" Su said, explaining that the country executed the response it had spent 17 years rehearsing.Meanwhile, the report highlighted how Taiwan has been able to keep its infected cases low from the very start because it implemented a travel ban on China as early as January, before any other country.According to media outlets, Australia has so far reported 6,322 COVID-19 cases, whereas Taiwan has 393.""We are so close to China, Taiwan would be the first country suffering from any outbreak,"" Su said, noting that the country conducts exercises relating to hospital and control measures once or twice a year, the main reason being that the earlier the better for such measures.(By Lionel Chiou and Ko Lin) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004130016
04/13/2020,"Taipei, April 13 (CNA) Taiwan's military is planning to spend millions of dollars to design and build its own military-use powered exoskeleton suit that is expected to begin production in 2023, according to the Defense Ministry's budget proposal for fiscal year 2020.The ministry's Armaments Bureau has allocated NT$250 million (US$8.3 million) in 2020 for use in developing a powered exoskeleton system, a mechanized wearable system that gives users greater strength and endurance when performing physical tasks.A military source told CNA that the military is hoping the high-tech suits can be used in wartime and in post-disaster rescue and relief missions, and they are expected to enter the production stage in 2023.The source said the project expects to learn from the U.S. military's experience in developing its own powered exoskeleton suit to increase the mobility and reduce the fatigue of its users, which could prove particularly helpful during combat or rescue missions.The suits can provide support to users in carrying taxing loads over long distances or reduce stress on leg muscles, the source said.Explaining the rationale behind the project, the source said only a handful of world powers, including the U.S., Japan, and Canada, are currently working on similar technology for military use, and their technology is not available at present for confidentiality reasons.Most of the powered exoskeleton suits available on the market right now are designed for medical and industrial use only and not suitable for military purposes, giving reason to Taiwan to try to develop its own equipment.Another key is that the suits need to be tailored to a wearer's body size, and those made in foreign countries may not fit the regular height and weight of Taiwanese soldiers, according to the source.The Armaments Bureau said it is now working closely with a number of private medical technology, automation and robotic companies, and a number of local universities, and the military's top research institution, the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCIST, 中山科學研究院), on the project.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004130018
04/13/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After Thai netizens found themselves embroiled in a massive flamewar with Chinese on Twitter, they used self-deprecating humor to counter insults hurled by their online adversaries.

Over the weekend, Chinese netizens discovered to their dismay that Thai actor Vachirawit Chivaaree, also known as ""Bright,"" who is the star of the hit TV soap opera ""2gether,"" is not actually gay like the character he portrays but has a girlfriend. His love interest was revealed to be actress Weeraya Sukaram, who goes by the nickname ""New"" and the Twitter handle ""nnevvy.""

Bright retweeted a photographer's images and wrote ""taken from 4 countries,"" one of which was Hong Kong. When Chinese netizens saw the retweet, they became enraged and called Bright out for labeling the special administrative region as a country.

Bright then apologized to Chinese followers for improperly labeling Hong Kong as a country. However, Thai netizens came to his defense, as they felt he had done nothing wrong.

Next, a Chinese netizen dug up a photo New had taken in Taiwan with Bright, commenting that she is a ""cute Chinese girl."" New replied ""What?"" in Thai, which in this context was a way to coyly express embarrassment.

Unfortunately for New, Chinese readers interpreted it as meaning that she was disappointed for being compared to a Chinese woman. A friend of New's then asked what style of dress she was wearing, and she responded ""Taiwanese style.""

Chinese netizens then combined New's perceived disappointment with being referred to as Chinese and her description of the outfit as ""Taiwanese"" as an affront to China and proceeded to accuse her of supporting Taiwanese separatists.

Chinese netizens then found that New had previously retweeted a post stating that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) had originated in China, which contradicts what Chinese have been told by their propaganda outlets: that the disease started in the U.S. Fury reached a fever pitch, and they began hurling insults at Thailand, with the hashtag #nnevvy soon becoming a battlefield on Twitter.

Instead of directly counter-attacking with insults of their own, Thais posted countless memes showing people being completely unphased by the best that Chinese trolls could throw at them. For example, a meme taken from the film ""Finding Neverland"" shows the character Peter, played by Freddie Highmore, crying and asking why Thais are not hurt by Chinese insults, to which Barrie, played by Johnny Depp, replies ""cultural difference, just stay in the wall.""

Many of these Chinese netizens criticized the Thai government, but Thais retorted that they frequently criticize their government on their own. One said that Thailand is poor, and a Thai responded that China is ""Pooh,"" as in Winnie the Pooh, to whom Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping (習近平) has frequently been compared..

Another tactic used was to shoot down Chinese Communist Party (CCP) talking points with censored facts and history. Soon, citizens of Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and others joined forces with the Thais with memes of their own.

He will team up with Wayne McNeil to present the CPBL to fans around the world at a time when professional baseball has all but come to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic.""In many ways baseball is a way of life, and being able to have a baseball season means that Taiwan is still able to have a normal way of life,"" Wang told CNA.In addition to reflecting the country's success at stopping the spread of the virus, it is also hoped that broadcasting the games in English will show the world the pandemic can be overcome, he said.Having previously served for 14 years in the CPBL's department of promotion and marketing, official publications, strategic planning, and international affairs, Wang said he hopes to help international fans fall in love with Taiwan baseball.""I think the fans will be interested in the players' skills and I will also fill in with background and stories about the league,"" he said. ""But I do hope, maybe later in the season, fans will be allowed into the stadium, which will show the complete package the CPBL has to offer.""When asked if the English broadcasts will continue for the rest of the season, Wang said it depends on viewership and he thinks that there is a good chance it will be received well.The last time the CPBL was broadcast to an international audience was over 30 years ago.The 2020 regular season will run until Oct. 14, with a total of 240 games scheduled, according to the CPBL website. The other teams in the CPBL are the Taichung-based CTBC Brothers and Yunlin-based Wei Chuan Dragons.

Bright started things off by inadvertently implying that Hong Kong is a separate country in a tweet, quickly upsetting sensitive Chinese fans. The fact that he had to apologize for such a minor detail spurred Thai netizens to leap to his defense.

Instead of directly counter-attacking with insults of their own, Thais posted countless memes showing people being completely unphased by the best that Chinese trolls could throw at them.

Over the ensuing days, other nationalities have sided with the Thais and posted memes of their own, including netizens from Japan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. On Tuesday, Twitter user Amazing (@this28644469) posted a painting commemorating the Seymour Expedition led by British Admiral Seymour during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.

The original painting depicted a bust of Seymour overlooking waves of soldiers from the Eight-Nation Alliance bravely charging towards Chinese Boxers. In the new version, Seymour has a flag of Thailand imposed over his head, symbolizing the Thais leading the online campaign, while the flags of the Philippines, Japan, India, British Colonial Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan fly over the soldiers of the ""New Eight-Nation Alliance (2020).""

As an overwhelming force of online warriors surges forward in the ""Nevvy War on Twitter,"" a sole Boxer can be seen making an obscene comment in Chinese as an Eight-Nation soldier prepares to deliver a fatal shot. In the caption, Amazing made it clear that Taiwan is different from China and supported the freeing of Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet. He then thanked Thais for standing up to China and called for the bombing of the Great Firewall of China.

Ironically, the Seymour Expedition was a failure, but this was soon succeeded by the Gaselee Expedition which eventually overpowered both Boxer and Qing army forces to sack Beijing and force China to pay reparations for the uprising. The punitive expedition has often been cited by communist Chinese leaders as an example of humiliation suffered at the hands of foreign oppressors and a justification for protectionist trade policies.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3916050

04/14/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) on Monday (April 13) announced that ID-based medical mask machines will be expanded to all of the city's districts next week.

After Taipei launched three ID-based mask vending machines on a trial basis in an effort to alleviate the long lines for medical masks, on Sunday (April 12), Ko on Monday announced the machines would be rolled out across Taipei's 12 districts next week. Based on the ratio of child to adult masks sold, Ko said the new machines will only sell adult masks to accelerate the transaction process and shorten queues.

Ko said that if all goes well during the trial, each machine should be able to sell up to 60 masks an hour. As there are currently three machines on trial, they can sell 180 per hour, and over the course of 10 hours, that would translate into 1,800 masks, reported CNA.

The machines are the result of a collaboration between the city government's technical task force, industry players, and the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA). On the first day of operations on Sunday, long lines formed behind the machines throughout the day, prompting Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) city councilor Chien Shu-pei (簡舒培) to question if the mayor had overhyped the machines, causing people to have unrealistic expectations about the wait involved.

After having inspected the first day of trial operations, Ko said that he thought the lines that formed were tolerable, but joked the purchase method amounted to an ""e-payment cram school,"" according to the report. Ko said the area for queuing needs to be adjusted and the machines should be placed back indoors.

According to sales statistics, only 15 percent of customers purchased children's masks, while 85 percent bought adult masks. Ko said the city is considering shifting the sale of children's masks to drugstores and only stock the machines with adult masks, so as to eliminate the need to choose between the two sizes, which takes up more time.

The machines require users to first insert their National Health Insurance (NHI) card before using a smartcard or app for payment, including Apple Pay, Google Pay, Line Pay, JKOPAY, EasyCard and cash. However, Ko said that one glitch that has been encountered is that when individuals insert their NHI card and swipe a contactless smart card too close together — the similar beeping sounds making it hard to tell which of the cards had just been read.

Ko said that many people think the first beep for the NHI card indicates the payment has been made, stopping them from continuing to swipe their smart card and resulting in a failed transaction. Ko recommended the machines only issue a sound when payment has been made.

He said another bug was the NHIA system not being notified of the purchase until the money had been deducted from the user's account. He said in some cases, this enabled people to purchase masks from both the machines and at drugstores in person, while the current ration only allows one purchase of nine masks every two weeks.

Ko said that he is coordinating with the manufacturers to ensure the machines will not sell masks until the user's NHI card successfully synchs up with the NHIA system.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3915960

During his daily press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Health Minister and Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) head Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) announced there had been zero new coronavirus cases detected in the country that day. He said the last time Taiwan had reported no new cases was March 9, meaning that Taiwan had gone 36 days with at least one coronavirus case per day.

The vast majority of cases reported over this period were imported from other countries as Taiwanese citizens fled from hotspots in Europe, Asia, and North America. Many feared these imported cases would bring a second wave of domestic infections to the country.

Fortunately, it appears the CECC's efforts at quickly identifying, isolating, and tracing the contacts of confirmed cases have held the virus at bay — for now. In other good news, Chen said all 214 of the Taiwanese citizens evacuated from Hubei province via charter plane in late March had been released from home isolation and begun self-health management.

In a Facebook post uploaded on Tuesday evening, the Grand Hotel Taipei announced that the famous landmark had formed the word ""zero"" with its rooms to ""tell all of Taiwan and the world that we did it!"" It then pointed out that bringing the number down to zero was no easy task and that continued vigilance is essential.

The hotel wrote that reaching zero was accomplished not only through the efforts of ""all the heroes,"" but also the result of teamwork across Taiwan. The post closed by encouraging everyone to continue their hard work and emphasizing the importance of coming together to defeat the disease.

A member of a Taiwanese Facebook group that specializes in information on face masks on Monday (April 13) announced that she had received several 3D polyurethane masks with the Taiwanese flag when purchasing her biweekly ration of masks. She wrote that ""big kids"" and adults can wear them but that they are too small for children.

She wrote that her masks were not for sale but that she would be willing to swap them for other unusual styles. A flurry of comments followed, with some claiming to have received the masks at pharmacies in New Taipei City's Shulin and Tucheng Districts as well as in the National Taipei University area of Sanxia District.

On Wednesday (April 15), another member of the group posted a photo of more masks emblazoned with the country's flag and asked others to comment if they had received any, but none of those who responded had. One person said that they had seen a pharmacy in front of Shulin Train Station selling them two days before.

Another person said that these masks are issued at government-contracted pharmacies and that the factory is in New Taipei City's Yingge District. They claimed that the factory supplies drug stores in Shulin and Tucheng.

In February, as fears over the coronavirus outbreak reached a fever pitch and Chinese purchases of face masks rapidly began to deplete the global supply, an image on social media showing masks guaranteed to keep Chinese away due to the presence of the dreaded Taiwanese flag quickly went viral. As some Taiwanese netizens pointed out, the face masks can indeed be purchased on the Champ Mask website in adult and child sizes in packages of 5 masks each, with 200 packages per box.

04/15/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan Supreme Court on Wednesday sentenced Wang Ching-yu (王景玉) to life in prison for the heinous murder he committed four years ago in Neihu District, Taipei City, CNA reported.

On March 28, 2016, the victim, 4, nicknamed “Little Light Bulb,” and her mother were on their way to an MRT station in Taipei to wait for the girl’s grandfather.

Wang, 36, came from behind the victim, who was riding a trolley bike at the time, and decapitated her with a cleaver in a random attack.

Prosecutors charged the suspect with murder and sought the death penalty. Shilin District Court judges adopted the defense’s argument that the suspect was suffering from a mental illness and sentenced him to life in prison, citing two international human rights conventions that prohibit the death penalty for defendants with disabilities or mental illness.

Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment in the second trial on the same grounds.

The High Court judges in the retrial adopted the testimony of doctors, which stated that Wang was not influenced by his mental illness when he committed the crime; however, they gave the defendant the same sentence due to other mitigating circumstances. They believed that if he received proper treatment and mental counseling, the possibility of further violent behavior would be low, which steered them from capital punishment.

The victim’s family appealed the retrial’s sentence. However, the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the lower court’s ruling and maintained the life sentence.

Claire Wang (王婉諭), the mother of the victim and a legislator, issued a statement after the Supreme Court ruling, stating, ""We feel sorry that the sentence is not what we expected.""",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3916876

(TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, said Thursday that it remains upbeat about its business outlook and is expecting sales growth of 19 percent this year, despite the economic impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.At an investor conference, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei (魏哲家) said the company is optimistic about demand for emerging technologies such as 5G applications and high performance computing (HPC) devices.TSMC also has confidence in its advanced processes and is likely to outperform the wider semiconductor industry this year, Wei said, forecasting an annual sales growth of 14-19 percent this year for the company.With the global semiconductor industry feeling the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, its 2020 sales are unlikely to meet the earlier estimate of 8 percent annual growth, and instead will either stay flat or drop slightly, Wei said, adding that the forecast does not include memory chipmakers.In the pure foundry sector, the 2020 sales growth will not meet the earlier projection of 17 percent but will range between 7 and 13 percent, he said, responding to questions by institutional investors.At the investor conference, TSMC reported a 0.8 percent sequential increase and 90.6 percent year-on-year growth in its first-quarter net profit to a record NT$$116.99 billion (US$3.90 billion).TSMC's earnings per share for the first quarter was NT$4.51, up from NT$4.47 in the fourth quarter of last year.Analysts said that solid demand for 5G applications and HPC devices helped TSMC weather the usual first-quarter slow season as well as the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.According to Wei, TSMC is expected to continue to benefit from its efforts to develop chips on advanced processes, and it is projecting that its 7 nanometer, 7-plus nm and 6nm processes will make up about 30 percent of its total sales in 2020.He said the 5nm process, which went into mass production this year, will contribute 10 percent to TSMC's total sales this year.Citing TSMC's upbeat business outlook, Wei said the company has decided to retain its 2020 capital expenditure plan at between US$15 billion and US$16 billion, the highest in its history.At the investor conference, TSMC CFO Wendell Huang (黃仁昭) said the company is expected to post US$10.1 billion to US$10.4 billion in consolidated sales for the second quarter, a sequential decline of only about 1 percent, as 5G and HPC applications will help the company weather the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the slow season.An earlier market estimate had projected a 5 percent quarterly drop in TSMC's second-quarter consolidated sales.Huang said TSMC's gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- is expected to range between 50 and 52 percent in the second quarter, compared with 51.8 percent in the first quarter.The company's operating margin -- the difference between sales, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- for the second quarter is forecast at 39-41 percent, compared with 41.4 percent in the first quarter, according to Huang.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202004160024

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — While United States President Donald Trump was still downplaying the importance of wearing face masks against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the National Security Council (NSC) approached Taiwan to obtain masks for senior White House officials, the Washington Post reported Thursday (April 16).

In mid-March, the Trump Administration insisted that only front-line medical personnel should wear masks while healthy people did not need them. However, officials at the White House were worried about an allegedly limited number of the face coverings available to staff there.

Matt Pottinger, a top deputy at the NSC familiar with Asian affairs and with SARS, struck a deal with Taiwan to import thousands of masks just two weeks before the administration reversed its policy and recommended the wearing of the coverings, according to the Washington Post.

Pottinger first mentioned the subject in a call with Taiwanese officials on March 14, and just days later, the island announced it would ship 500,000 masks to the U.S. While most of those ended up in the strategic national stockpile, the NSC decided to set aside 3,600 masks for the White House. Half of those were destined for the body’s own staff, with the other half to be distributed by the White House medical unit to other employees at the complex, the Washington Post reported.

The White House denied there ever was a shortage of masks, as three quarters of staff were now working from home, and enough face coverings were left to adequately service the senior officials needed to run government.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3917466

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As world leaders are pointing a finger at what U.S. President called a ""China-centric"" World Health Organization for failing to respond to the human-to-human coronavirus transmission, a Taiwanese health official was thanked for his vigilance — and his warning four months ago — to prepare the whole country for the deadly outbreak.

On Wednesday (April 15), Lo Yi-chun (羅一鈞), deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), was said to have spotted a post on Taiwan's Reddit-like platform, PTT, on the early morning of Dec. 31. The post shares a number of screengrabs taken from different Chinese online forums. The screengrabs include an announcement from Wuhan's health department dated Dec. 30, 2019, which notes that a number of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded and demands medical institutions in the city report to the department if there is a case with similar symptoms.

(PTT screengrab)

The post also shared a screengrab of a group chat between the deceased Chinese whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang and other medics about some patients exhibiting signs of a new SARS-like illness in early December, three months before the conversation was revealed to the world in mid-March — sadly, after Li's passing. Li was detained by the Chinese police in the name of ""spreading false rumors"" and ""disrupting social orders"" in January, and was later infected with the virus.

A photocopy of an RNA test report was also placed in the PTT post, which comes from a Wuhan medical center. The test report shows a patient tested positive for a type of SARS coronavirus. Another screengrab presents a group chat between doctors at the Wuhan Union Hospital, in which a medic confirmed a case of coronavirus infection and its isolation for treatment. The doctor, surnamed Liu, reminded his friends in the group to stay alert.

At the end of the PTT post, the writer, who is said to have been a Taiwanese physician until recently, reminded Taiwanese netizens to pay attention to personal hygiene to avoid catching the virus.

According to Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), CDC official Lo Yi-chun found the post on Dec. 31 and quickly reported it to the top of his organization. The health official also wrote an email the same day to the World Health Organization (WHO), stating his worries and requesting its attention as well as any available information about the coronavirus. The email, according to CDC chief Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), should have been taken seriously, given the WHO staff's medical backgrounds. Apparently, however, it was not.

“News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, CHINA. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were believed not SARS; however, the samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment. “I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us. Thank you very much in advance for your attention to this matter.""

In addition to the email to the WHO on Dec. 31, Taiwan's health authorities immediately decided to require an on-board inspection of flights from Wuhan.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The World Medical Association (WMA) wrote to the World Health Organization (WHO) calling for Taiwan to be allowed to attend the World Health Assembly (WHA), reports said Friday (April 17).

The letter followed growing questions about the handling of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been accused of toeing the Chinese government’s line while engaging in a war of words with Taiwan.

According to the WMA letter, the virus outbreak has “illustrated with terrible consequences how wrong and damaging for global health it is to exclude Taiwan from unrestricted and effective participation in the World Health Organization.”

Both during the 2003 SARS crisis and the current pandemic, the WHO failed to pay sufficient attention to Taiwan, leaving the world “paying a high price,” said the letter signed by WMA Council Chairman Frank Ulrich Montgomery and WMA President Miguel Jorge.

The WHO should “make a fresh start” for the upcoming WHA by opening its doors to a Taiwanese delegation and stop playing political games, the letter cautioned.

Taiwan has been repeatedly praised for its handling of the pandemic, with Friday being the third day within a week that no new cases of the coronavirus have been reported.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Foreign citizens who entered Taiwan before March 21 will be allowed to extend their stay by an additional 30 days without having to file an official application, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday (April 17).

As the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic decimates air travel and countries impose restrictive immigration rules, many travelers who have been trapped overseas are unable to respect official residency deadlines. MOFA has already allowed foreign visitors one 30-day extension, with Friday's announcement now allowing for a total extension of 60 days.

The new measure applies to all foreigners who entered Taiwan legally before March 21, regardless of whether they did so visa-free, with a visa on arrival, or with any other official visa, as long as they have not overstayed yet, CNA reported.

Nevertheless, MOFA cautioned that a person's stay could not exceed 180 days, with the first full day after arrival being counted as day one.

In the case of overstayers, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) has a program, valid from March 20 to June 30, during which people who voluntarily report to the authorities will not be detained and will receive the lowest possible fine.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3918055

04/19/2020,"Taipei, April 19 (CNA) Taiwan confirmed 22 new COVID-19 cases Sunday, 21 of which involved people on a military ship that sailed to Taiwan's Pacific ally Palau in March, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).The latest confirmed cases brought the country's total confirmed cases to 420, the CECC said.The CECC announced on Saturday that three people aboard the naval supply vessel that was part of the Navy's three-ship ""Fleet of Friendship"" had tested positive for COVID-19.These were the first confirmed CODIV-19 infections involving Taiwan's military since the outbreak was first reported in Wuhan in China in late 2019.The supply ship Panshi (磐石), together with a Cheng Kung-class guided-missile frigate, Yueh Fei (岳飛), and a Lafayette class frigate ""Kang Ding"" (康定), departed Taiwan in early March for a visit to Palau from March 12 to 15 and then traveled at sea for more than 20 days before returning to its home port in Zuoying in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung on April 9.The three ships then remain docked at the port for an extra six days with all personnel staying on board to comply with CECC quarantine requirements that only passengers on ships that had not docked at a foreign port for 30 days could disembark.It was only on April 15 that the sailors could leave the ships and return to their homes.The CECC said Sunday that aside from the three who tested positive by Saturday, all of the more than 700 people aboard the three ships were put into quarantine and were tested for the new coronavirus late Saturday, with 21 of them testing positive.All 24 of the confirmed COVID-19 patients (22 males and 2 females) from the fleet served on the Panshi vessel, and they are all under isolation in hospitals for treatment, according to the CECC.The other 700-plus people on the ships have been put in six quarantine locations across the country and an isolated military camp for a required 14-day quarantine, it said.The CECC is still trying to determine the source of the cluster infection.On Sunday, the head of the CECC, Health Ministry Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), retracted his comment from the previous day that the virus was likely contracted in Palau, one of Taiwan's 15 diplomatic allies worldwide.He said instead that health authorities are still conducting an investigation to determine if the 24 cases contracted the virus locally or overseas.Chen said, meanwhile, that the CECC would issue alerts by text message later Sunday to more than 2,000 people who had contact with the 744 people aboard the three military ships, reminding them to practice ""self-health management"" for 14 days and avoid visiting public spaces to prevent community transmission.The 744 aboard the military vessels included naval officers, servicepersons, students in the naval and political warfare academics.He also advised those who receive CECC alerts to stay at home and call the toll-free disease prevention hotline 1922 to seek medical advice if they feel unwell or develop COVID-19 symptoms.The only other new COVID-19 case confirmed Sunday was a man in his 20s who studied in the United States for a year before coming back to Taiwan on April 17.As of Sunday, 341 of the 420 confirmed COVID-19 cases that have been reported in Taiwan were classified as imported and 55 as indigenous infections, while the 24 cases from the Navy are still pending, the CECC said.So far, Taiwan has reported six COVID-19 deaths and 189 recovered patients, while the others are still undergoing treatment in hospital isolation rooms, according to the CECC.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 2,331,516 patients in 184 countries and regions worldwide, including 732,224 in the U.S., 191,726 in Spain, 175,925 in Italy, and 173,956 in France, with a total of 158,722 fatalities, according to CECC numbers.(By Chen Wei-ting and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004190009

Because of these factors, parts of the northern and eastern areas of the nation will receive intermittent showers on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the weather in central Taiwan will turn from mostly cloudy to sporadically rainy, the latest weather forecast said.

On Sunday, temperature highs are forecast to reach 30-32 degrees Celsius in western Taiwan, and 27-29 degrees in the east, the CWB said.

Wu Te-jung (吳德榮), a professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, said the frontal system is moving southward toward Taiwan.

Amid its approach, the cloud over the northern area will increase to bring down the temperature there on Monday, he said.

But before that, we definitely have to keep social distancing,"" he said.Chen suggested that as long as people live in a ""self-limited way"" by cutting their social contacts in half, then a ""semi-normal"" lifestyle can still be achieved.On reopening travel and trade, Chen said all nations must share data and make their outbreak status transparent so that international transportation can be coordinated.Studies on antibodies and blood sample testing will be needed to know the infection status of each country, he said.As to when will life return to normal, Chen admitted it was difficult to predict accurately as he sees the outbreak in Europe has having reached its peak and on the way down while it is still going up in the United States.Nevertheless, ""all nations are mobilized, and they are doing much better than one month ago. It's a kind of good phenomenon of globalization, COVID-19 containment,"" he said.In the interview, he also expressed reservations about the contention that the new coronavirus originated from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a live animal market in Wuhan.""If we look back at all the reports among the first 42 cases published in academic journals, around 10 of them have no history of going to Huanan Seafood Market,"" he said.(By Yeh Su-ping and Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004190006
04/19/2020,"Taipei, April 19 (CNA) China might take advantage of the power vacuum in the region following the halt of overseas movements by the United States military, but a military offensive against Taiwan is unlikely, according to a Taiwanese defense analyst.""The U.S. military deployed in the western Pacific has been a force that secures the safety of the region. Whether China sees the halt of U.S. military movement as an opportunity to take, is a national security issue worth watching,"" said Chang Jung-Ming (章榮明), a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR).According to foreign media reports, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper ordered in March a ban on troop movements overseas for 60 days, in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the military.Currently, four U.S. aircraft carriers assigned in the Indo-Pacific region are all quarantined at different ports, and war games such as Balikatan 2020 held by the U.S. and the Philippines and the Large Scale Exercise 2020 were also postponed.Writing in the latest issue of Defense Security Weekly on April 10, Chang pointed to the possibility of China taking actions in the region to test the U.S.'s reaction or establish ""facts on the ground"" as future bargaining chips.He cited two incidents, one on March 30, in which a Chinese fishing boat collided with the Japanese destroyer Shimakaze in the East China Sea, and another on April 2, in which a Chinese Coast Guard ship collided with and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat in the South China Sea, as examples of such actions.However, U.S. air assets continue to operate near Taiwan even after the stop movement order, Chang said, with American war planes appearing in the region at least five times between March 25 to April 8.""On March 31, U.S. war planes flew over the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea in the same day,"" he said, concluding that the stop movement order would only minimally affect Taiwan.On the possibility of an armed attack by China against Taiwan, Chang said the current environment did not favor such a move, especially with the international community unhappy with China's lack of transparency in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.Other factors precluding such an attack would be its lack of legitimacy because Taiwan has not broken the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chang argued, and he also felt the fear of a defeat that would undermine the authority of China's leadership was at play.At the same time, conquering Taiwan is not the top priority of the Xi Jinping (習近平) administration, which is focused on getting people back to work and preparing for a possible second-wave virus outbreak.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202004190013

04/20/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A bench-clearing brawl broke out during a Taiwanese professional baseball game on Sunday (April 19), getting extra attention from the outside world as Taiwan is the only country with active professional sports games during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

A melee broke out during a Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) game on Sunday when a pitcher from the Fubon Guardians intentionally struck a batter from the Rakuten Monkeys. The incident drew praise from baseball fans for livening up what has been a boring period, with most of the world's professional leagues sidelined by the coronavirus.

The conflict started when Kuo Yen-wen (郭嚴文) told an umpire that the Guardians were using an illegal bat. Umpires halted play to inspect a bat for having an illegal marking on it.

Officials decided that the image of a human head on a strange animal body was not illegal, and play resumed. Angry at Kuo's accusation, Guardians pitcher Henry Sosa then threw three pitches ever closer to Kuo before finally hitting him on the buttocks with the fourth.

As soon as Sosa's pitch connected, both teams swarmed onto the field and started pushing and shoving each other. After the dust settled, the umpires decided not to eject any players and allowed the game to continue.

In the end, the Monkeys defeated the Guardians with a score of 3 to 1. Bored out of their socks over the past few weeks, several international sportscasters were pleased to see the fracas break out.

The first report came from Wuhan,"" said Tedros.""Taiwan didn't report any human-to-human transmission,"" he stressed.MOFA spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) responded Tuesday that the key point was not which country first informed the WHO of the epidemic but the global health body's evaluation and handling of the matter.She said Taiwan hoped the WHO Secretariat would give a further explanation as to which countries gave relevant reports in the initial period after the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan late last year and how the WHO dealt with the information.Taiwan in March publicized the email as providing an early warning to the WHO. According to Chou Jih-haw (周志浩), director-general of the CDC, Taiwan said in the email that it was aware of a respiratory illness in Wuhan and was worried about the possibility of human-to-human transmission.The claim has been used by Taiwan, international media and the United States in attacking the WHO for dropping the ball in its response, including by not identifying human-to-human transmission of the disease until Jan. 20.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus tweeted on March 24: ""Dec. 31 -- that's the same day Taiwan first tried to warn WHO of human-to-human transmission.""U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter on April 17: ""Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans?""When the actual content of the email was revealed by Taiwan on April 11, it did not mention human-to-human transmission and asked if the WHO had any information on the issue.The email read: ""News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, CHINA. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were believed not SARS; however the samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment.""I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us. Thank you very much in advance for your attention to this matter,"" the email concluded.Ou on Tuesday repeated Taiwan's contention that although Taiwan did not ""clearly state the possibility of human-to-human transmission in that email due to no confirmed cases in Taiwan at that time, public health professionals should have had the ability to judge the possibility based on the content of Taiwan's e-mail.""WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said on Monday, however, that Taiwan did not tell the WHO anything it did not already know.""There was no reference made in that query to anything other than to what had previously been reported in news media and actually referred to a response from the Wuhan health authorities clarifying and confirming that the cases existed,"" he said.""The information from Taiwan was in line with information that we had received from other sources,"" Ryan saidHe pointed to ""more detailed"" information received on Dec. 31 through its Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources platform from Wuhan describing the cluster.(By Chen Yun-yu, Tang Pei-chun and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004210020

04/21/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — YouTube has restored a video of Taiwanese indigenous children dancing in traditional thongs, after deleting it on the grounds that its content was a breach of the terms and conditions stipulated by the video sharing site.

CNA reported on Tuesday (April 21) that the video posted by Yan Zi-yu (顏子矞), a teacher at the Yayu Elementary School in Lanyu Township off the coast of Taitung, had been taken down by YouTube, which left Yan astonished and baffled and sparked protests from island residents.

Yan received a message from YouTube on April 16, which said that the site had deleted the video after receiving complaints, the report said.

The teacher said, “I guess they deemed the scantily dressed children to be a violation of social norms,” filing a complaint of his own to YouTube.

Yan added that the video shows the children dancing in traditional dress and that its purpose is to promote Taiwan's indigenous culture to those for whom it is unfamiliar.

Upon learning of the video's deletion, island residents expressed their anger and protested to YouTube, saying, “Is it very difficult to respect cultural differences?” Subsequently, they asked YouTube to restore the video.

Since then, it has apparently been restored.

In a post on Thursday (April 23), the 31-year-old influencer Grace Chow (周揚青) confirmed she broke up earlier this year with the massively popular singer and actor, also known as “Little Pig” or Xiao Zhu (小豬), who is 40. The pair have been an item since 2011 and there had even been talk of marriage.

No more. In a blazing break-up letter published under her name on the Sina Weibo microblogging website, Chow detailed how her heart had been broken after scrolling through his phone and finding evidence galore of his many infidelities.

Chow said she had previously caught him cheating but had forgiven him. “Time after time, I forgave your betrayal because I was impressed by your regret and commitment.”

She said Luo had a secret second phone that he used for hookups, alleging he would not only have trysts on work trips abroad but also at the home they shared when she was away. This included one-night stands with fans, colleagues, and many wannabe stars over the entire course of their relationship.

She suggested the Taiwanese actress and singer Butterfly Kaile (簡愷樂) was one of Little Pig’s many booty calls. In a reply on an Instagram post, Chow said she had been tested for sexually transmitted diseases but was in fact STD-free.

“Butterfly should check her body out too,” Chow wrote. She also made the explosive claim that Luo enjoyed “multiplayer games” – or orgies – “that normal people cannot imagine.”

The “Dear Zhu letter” will have hit Luo’s fan base hard, as he has more than 50 million followers on Weibo. Replying to the post, Luo said he would reflect on his mistakes.

The former boyband member is also a TV personality, making millions in China, where he cultivates an image as a dutiful son and faithful boyfriend. In image sensitive Taiwan and China, the revelations may well put an end to his career.

At the time of writing, there were more than 1 million comments following Chow’s post. Most of the replies were from women supporting Chow and putting the boot into Luo.

Many women appeared to equate Luo’s actions with men in general, painting them as shameless cheats. For example, “Laurinda” wrote: “I have experienced what you have experienced and know how painful it is. I admire your bravery.”

Men seemed to take a different approach and were full of admiration for Luo’s X-rated adventures. They were amazed that between having a full-time girlfriend and successful career he had time for so many sexual liaisons.

One meme suggested a self-help book titled, “How Show Luo Manages Time,” with tips to make you “effective” and “efficient” all day (and night) long.

Another meme compared Luo to a “time assassin” and said: “It’s not how much time you have, but how you use it.”

Yet another Weibo comment, from “Canoe,” rhetorically asked: “How can Show Luo restore his reputation? Only by developing a novel coronavirus vaccine.”

But the final word should go to Chow, who recalled of her time with Luo: “When we were together you once joked that I would write a super long rap to scold you if we broke up.”

04/24/2020,"Update: HK bookstore selling books critical of Beijing reopens in TaipeiTaipei, April 24 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) on Friday said a Chinese national living in Singapore is the likely source of an online threat made against dissident Hong Kong bookseller Lam Wing-kee (林榮基).Lam, who founded Causeway Bay Books in Hong Kong in 1994 and sold works critical of Chinese leaders, fled to Taiwan last year amid fears of persecution, and plans to reopen his bookstore in Taipei Saturday.On Wednesday, a message was left on the Facebook page of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MOC) from an account under the name ""Jonathan Gao,"" claiming to be a member of the Chinese Unification Promotion Party and threatening to kill Lam, the CIB said in a press release.Investigators found that the account, which also left a threatening message on the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) Facebook page, was registered to a Singapore telephone number, the CIB said.The telephone number had also been used to register accounts on the messaging apps WeChat and Line, with the name on the latter account -- ""Gao Zheyuan"" -- written in the Hanyu Pinyin Romanization system commonly used in China, the CIB said.The bureau said it will contact Singapore's local representative office to request that Singaporean law enforcement follow up on the case.The online threat is among several incidents this week which Lam believes constitute an attempt by Beijing to intimidate him.On Monday, Lam said he received a letter threatening legal action from a similarly-named bookstore in New Taipei City, which completed its business registration only weeks before him in March.The following day, a man threw red paint on him while he ate breakfast at a coffee shop in Taipei's Zhongshan District. Three men, all Taiwan nationals, were subsequently arrested in Kaohsiung for involvement in the attack.In an interview Friday, Lam said Taiwan's government should consider passing a foreign agents registration act to prevent the Chinese government from exercising undue influence in the country.He noted that the Hong Kong democracy activists Joshua Wong (黃之鋒) and Denise Ho (何韻詩) both suffered politically-motivated attacks in Taiwan, and said he worried that the next attack ""won't involve paint"" and could target a Taiwanese person.Regarding the incidents, MAC Deputy Minister and Spokesman Chiu Chui-cheng (邱垂正) said Thursday that any Chinese involvement could be prosecuted under the Anti-Infiltration Act, which the government passed in January.(By Liu Chien-pang, Liao Zong-han and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202004240012
04/24/2020,"Taipei, April 24 (CNA) In the wake of the escalating spread of COVID-19 around the world, business sentiment in the local manufacturing sector weakened in March, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) said Friday.TIER, one of the leading think tanks in Taiwan, said the composite index for the manufacturing sector, which gauges business sentiment among manufacturers, fell 6.48 points from a month earlier to 82.35, the lowest level since February 2009.Business sentiment in the construction industry and the service sector was also impacted, with the composite indexes for the two down 3.99 and 3.44, respectively, at 85.79 and 82.19 in March, TIER said.TIER president Chang Chien-yi (張健一) said at a news conference that the spread of COVID-19 is expected to continue to affect business sentiment in Taiwan in the second quarter when the full extent of the impact will become clearer.The think tank has lowered its forecast of Taiwan's economic growth in 2020 by 1.09 percentage point from an earlier estimate made in January to 1.58 percent, forecasting quarterly growth of 2.00, 0.30, 1.56 and 2.40 percent this year, respectively.The silver lining is that strong demand for emerging technologies like 5G is expected to boost demand for semiconductors made in Taiwan and remote work and learning are likely to help the local information communication technology industry, which will mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, Chang said.According to a TIER survey conducted in March, 16.7 percent of manufacturers believed the business climate will improve over the coming six months, compared with 20.2 percent in a similar poll in February, while 39.7 percent said it will weaken, up from 36.2 percent a month earlierCommenting on the service sector, TIER cited the survey as saying respondents in the food/beverage, tourism, and insurance industries were more downbeat about the next six months.As for the construction industry, TIER said, business sentiment was hurt by delays in some new private projects in the wake of a lack of construction materials and workers, although government efforts to push for public infrastructure helped limit the impact on sentiment.At the news conference, Liu Pei-chen (劉佩真), a TIER economist, said local home buyers for self-dwelling purposes continued to enter the property market in March, at a time when the local central bank cut interest rates.According to TIER, transactions of residential and commercial property in the six largest cities in Taiwan rose 9.9 percent from a month earlier in March.(By Pan Tzu-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202004240015
04/24/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A team from Taiwan’s National Yang-Ming University has developed a videoconferencing platform with free access based on the open-source software Jitsi Meet.

Led by Chen Yu-chun (陳育群), an assistant professor at the university’s School of Medicine, the team has incorporated new features to the application for improved security. Through a one-time encryption key, users will be able to convene virtual meetings without the need to sign in.

The software can be connected via a local area network with limited access and the online meeting rooms will be closed automatically after all participants have left to ensure data security. The source code is now freely available.

Chen, who is also a doctor at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, embarked on the project by tapping his experience in assisting the hospital to develop an online medical diagnosis system. As the need for online meetings increases with employees being asked to work remotely amid the coronavirus, he hopes to offer relevant expertise for the creation of a safer videoconferencing system.

The effort came following a host of security and privacy breach incidents surrounding Zoom, which is a videoconferencing software product developed by a company founded by Chinese-American Eric Yuan (袁征).

The application has sparked national security concerns, and Taiwan’s digital minister Audrey Tang (唐鳳) has recommended Jitsi Meet as an alternative. The application, however, had lacked privacy features before the improvements made by Chen’s team.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3922265

The Taipei City Fire Department said the fire alarm and the automatic sprinkler system had been turned off when the accident took place, and the fire should be treated as a serious case of human negligence. The authorities suspected that the fire may have been related to the elevator construction on the fifth floor, but said it has not been confirmed.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A fire that erupted Sunday morning (April 26) at the Cashbox Partyworld KTV bar on Linsen North Road of Zhongshan District has taken five lives and injured 50 individuals, including two who are currently in critical condition after being found OHCA.

At 10:59 a.m. Sunday, a fire raged through a 14-story building in which the karaoke bar is located. Several customers at the KTV were waving at the firefighters from their windows before being rescued from the smoke and flame.

The fire was put out at around 11:30 a.m., according to the Taipei City Fire Department. 55 individuals, including seven who had showed no signs of breathing, were injured and have been transported to National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), MacKay Memorial Hospital, and Shin Kong Hospital.

According to CNA, the first nine floors of the building belongs to Cashbox Partyworld, and all customers have been successfully rescued, while five staff members still have not. A total of 179 firefighters and medical staffers, composing 34 fire engines, 4 aerial ladder trucks, and 17 ambulances, were sent to battle the flames and provide medical assistance.

Some of the victims told reporters that neither the fire alarm nor the automatic sprinkler system went off. They added that a few emergency exit doors were also locked and that they were forced to hide in the bathroom and wait for help.

While the cause of the fire has yet to be determined by investigators, the fire appeared to have started on the fifth floor.

Effective from midnight Sunday, the state-run petroleum refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan will cut its retail gasoline prices per liter by NT$0.9 (US$0.03) and NT$1.0 per liter for diesel, it said.

After the adjustments, prices at CPC pumps will drop to their lowest levels since February 2000, with NT$16.1 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$17.6 per liter for 95 octane unleaded and NT$19.6 per liter for 98 octane unleaded, according to CPC data.

For super diesel, retail prices will be lowered to NT$13 per liter, the lowest since November 1999, CPC said.

The low prices are a result of falling demand for crude oil in the United States amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, coupled with overproduction and dwindling storage space, which has forced West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices into negative territory for the first time in history this past week.

Meanwhile, CPC's main competitor, Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC), announced identical price cuts Sunday, to take effect at 1 a.m. Monday.

After the cuts, prices at FPCC gas stations will be NT$16.1 per liter for 92 octane unleaded, NT$17.5 per liter for 95 octane unleaded, NT$19.6 per liter for 98 octane unleaded and NT$12.8 per liter for diesel.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3923302

""Do you support the president in pushing for the establishment of a new constitution reflecting the reality of Taiwan?"" Lin said.The votes will be declared valid if 25 percent of the electorate, or around 5 million ballots cast, and a majority votes in favor of each of the two petitions.Lin said if the two referendum proposals pass, it will show that more than 5 million Taiwanese support forming a new constitution for the country, which will serve as a foundation for the government upon which to act.Should the government decide to write a new constitution, it will first have to hold a national conference to come up with details and procedures before another round of national-level meetings on drafting a new constitution is held.Should the draft bills of the new constitution be completed, a national-level vote will then have to be held to endorse it, he added.According to Lin, the TNC was formed in 2019 by presidential adviser and longtime advocate of Taiwan independence Koo Kwang-ming (辜寬敏), with the main purpose of pushing for the drafting of a new constitution.According to Lin, the TNC argues that the country's existing constitution was adopted in China back in 1947 for China before the Republic of China (ROC) government relocated to Taiwan in 1949, and does not fit for Taiwan, despite having been amended seven times since 1996.A new constitution is therefore needed to differentiate Taiwan from China to assert the nation's sovereignty and raise awareness of the Taiwanese public over the issue, he said.(By Yeh Su-ping and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004260008

According to Taiwan's representative office in India, 295 Taiwanese have expressed a desire to board the charter plane, while 143 of them have already confirmed their status with MOFA.

The stranded Taiwanese are expected to meet at the Indira Gandhi International Airport at 4 p.m. on May 4 before departing several hours later. The price of travel for each individual will be determined by the final number of passengers aboard the charter flight.

During the daily press conference Sunday afternoon, Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) Deputy Commander Chen Tsung-yen (陳宗彥) said that the returning Taiwanese have been asked to report their health status and will undergo screening before being allowed to board the aircraft. He added that the evacuees will all be quarantined upon arrival in Taiwan.

Chen pointed out that many Taiwanese have actually changed their minds about taking the charter flight, as travelling to New Delhi has become more difficult in the midst of India's nationwide lockdown. He explained that making stops at different airports is unlikely at the moment, since it would significantly delay matters to receive approval for extended landing permissions, reported New Talk.

He then attached the bulb to the lampshade to complete the improvised sterilizer.He experimented by using coins to determine if the sterilizer works, and found many microorganisms on a slice of white bread eight days after he pressed one unsterilized coin on to it, Chen said in a Soochow statement that was released Friday.In comparison, far fewer microorganisms grew on another slice of bread that had been touched by the coin he had sterilized with his homemade device, according to Chen.However, he warned that while UV rays can kill germs, they are also harmful to the eyes and skin.(By Chen Chih-chung and Elizabeth Hsu) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202004260015
04/26/2020,"Taipei, April 26 (CNA) A recent training mission of the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning, which sailed through waters near Japan and Taiwan and into the South China Sea near Vietnam, has been seen by a Taiwanese defense analyst as a maneuver with the aim of ""hitting three birds with one stone.""Wang Tsun-Yen (王尊彥), an assistant research fellow at the Division of Non-traditional Security and Military Missions under the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), made the observation in the debut issue of the Defense Security Biweekly April 24.The Liaoning's long-range training mission that began on April 10, taking it through the Miyako Strait near Okinawa, then moving past eastern Taiwan and entering the South China Sea through the Bashi channel, could be in response to two maritime incidents involving Japan and Vietnam, Wang said.On March 30, a Chinese fishing boat collided with the Japanese destroyer Shimakaze in the East China Sea, while on April 2, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel sank a Vietnamese fishing boat in the South China Sea.There were 10 injuries but no loss of life in the two incidents.Beijing's decision to sail the Liaoning and its escort ships through waters near Japan instead of going to the South China Sea directly through the Taiwan Strait, showed that the voyage was clearly targeted at Japan, although it was also designed to exert pressure on Vietnam, Wang said.He speculated that the Chinese fishing boat's collision with Japan's destroyer could be part of an asymmetric move to drive Japan's Self-Defense Force out of the area, citing reports that the Chinese fishing boat was actually a militia vessel.As to the incident in the South China Sea, although it was not the first time China and Vietnam had clashed at sea, judging from the timing, China might have been wanting to teach the Southeast Asian neighbor a lesson for getting too close to Japan and the United States, Wang said, citing the visit of the Japanese helicopter carrier Izumo to Vietnam in June 2019, and a port call of U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt in March 2020.As most U.S. aircraft carriers are currently docked due to the COVID-19 coronavirus, China wants to convey the message that ""the U.S. big brother is not reliable"" and that the ""Chinese People's Liberation Army is not affected by the outbreak and still can go to your doorsteps,"" Wang said.""With the Chinese navy fleet's sailing routes, it is quite obvious that China wants to show its muscle to Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan with a strategy aimed at hitting three birds with one stone,"" he said.However, Wang said that China does not want to further escalate tension on two fronts at the same time, as Japan and Vietnam both play important roles in geopolitics and Beijing itself is busy handling internal and external problems, including the coronavirus pandemic.As Japan and Vietnam have strengthened two-way security cooperation, including the signing of several agreements and Japan's donations of patrol boats to Vientam amid China's increased assertiveness, any easing of tension in the region is unlikely in the near future, Wang concluded.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202004260009

04/27/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan has reportedly test-fired a new missile capable of striking targets within inner China, which will soon enter mass production.

The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) is said to have fired a slew of medium-range missiles and rockets earlier this month at the Jiupeng (九鵬) military base in Pingtung, the southernmost county of Taiwan, wrote UDN.

The tests are believed to have included the Yun Feng (雲峰) missile, a supersonic land-attack cruise missile that has a range of 1,500 kilometers, according to the UDN article. The missile, fitted with a ramjet engine, can carry a semi-armor piercing high explosive and fragmentation warhead.

Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), a senior analyst at the Institute of National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), said the surface-to-surface missile could be deployed to weaken China’s combat capability. The weapon is believed to be able to attack strategic targets including airports, harbors, and command bases located in central China, CNA quoted Su as saying.

Land-based missile systems including Yun Feng and other cruise missiles are a vital asset of Taiwan’s arsenal when engaging in asymmetric warfare against China, Su stated. As the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) poses the greatest threat to Taiwan in the event of a military conflict, the island country would be able to better defend itself if it could launch attacks on China’s air bases.

04/28/2020,"Taipei, April 28 (CNA) The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said Tuesday there is no need for mass testing for the COVID-19 coronavirus in Taiwan, as the rate of infection so far has been quite low.Over the past 100 days, some 4.8 million people sought medical attention or reported to health authorities that they had coronavirus-like symptoms, and 60,956 of them were tested, said Health Minister and CECC head Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) at a press conference on the 100th day since the center was established.Of the 60,956 people tested, only 429 were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, Chen said, adding that authorities could not identify the source of infection in only 10 cases.With an infection rate of around 0.7 percent among those tested and 0.009 percent among those who reported COVID-like symptoms, there is no need to move toward mass testing, as public health experts have been advocating, Chen said.The situation in Taiwan is different than in countries like South Korea and Italy, where large numbers of infections have been recorded and lockdowns and mass testing became necessary, he said, in an apparent response to a suggestion made two weeks ago by public health experts that testing could be expanded using a rapid diagnostic test.Taiwan currently uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which takes two to four hours to produce results but is much more accurate than the quick test that takes 15 minutes, Chen said.He said the PCR test allows for precise identification of the COVID-19 coronavirus, while the rapid test looks for antigens or antibodies to the virus.Another factor related to the issue of mass testing is cost, which so far stands at NT$183 million for the 60,956 PCR tests conducted to date, Chen said.Assuming that the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan is 18 per 10,000 persons, it would cost NT$54 billion to test 18 million people, in order to identify the 32,577 potential asymptomatic carriers, and about 1,797 false negatives could be expected, he said.On April 13, public health experts in Taiwan issued a call for expanded testing to identify people with COVID-19 antibodies, saying that would allow people to safely go back to jobs where they are needed.""If people knew their immunity status, then they could go back to normal working lives, especially the much-needed healthcare personnel,"" Chen Hsiu-hsi (陳秀熙), vice dean of National Taiwan University's College of Public Health, said at a press conference in Taipei.The issue of expanded testing was raised in view of the impact of COVID-19 on offices and businesses that have had to adopt the government's guidelines on social distancing.To date, Taiwan has recorded 429 cases of the disease, 343 of which have been classified as imported and 55 as local infections, according to CECC statistics.Another 31 cases in a cluster from a three-ship Navy flotilla are still being investigated to determine whether they were local or imported infections.Taiwan on Tuesday reported no new cases of COVID-19 for the third consecutive day and the sixth time this month, according the CECC.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 3,072,806 people in 184 countries and regions, including 1,000,612 in the United States, 228,460 in Spain, 199,414 in Italy, 196,069 in France and 157,149 in the United Kingdom, with a total of 210,351 fatalities, according to CECC data as of Tuesday.(By William Yen) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004280019

The High Court ruled that the seven individuals' actions constitute inciting others to commit a crime and obstructing officials in the performance of their public duties.Wei said that Tuesday's ruling was tantamount to telling thousands of protesters they were mobsters and were incited to take part with no capacity for independent thought.Independent Legislator Freddy Lim (林昶佐), a supporter of the Sunflower Movement, called the ruling incomprehensible and unfair, saying police officers accused of using excessive force against protesters have still not been identified.However, former Premier Jiang Yi-huah (江宜樺), who ordered riot police to evict protesters occupying the Executive Yuan, on Tuesday hailed the ruling as belated justice, noting that the occupation of the Executive Yuan on March 23 ""was not a peaceful demonstration"" and the Sunflower Movement ""was not civil disobedience.""Civil disobedience, also called passive resistance, is defined as the refusal to obey the demands or commands of a government or occupying power, without resorting to violence or active measures of opposition.Jiang said the Sunflower Movement protesters attacked the police, incited the masses, broke into government offices and vandalized public property.(By Liu Shih-yi, Liu Kuan-ting and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004280018
04/28/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Foreign residents in Taiwan have been angered by the appearance of a sign at a Taipei restaurant that only allows foreigners to order takeout, while Taiwanese are allowed to dine inside.

On Monday (April 27), a member of the Facebook group Foreigners Society in Taiwan shared a photo of a discriminatory sign posted at an Italian restaurant and cat cafe in Taipei's Xinyi District. The sign states that due to the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), foreigners are only allowed to order food to go, while ""locals"" are allowed to enter on the condition that they wear face masks.

The person who posted the image said that the photo had been taken by a friend when they visited the restaurant on Sunday (April 26). He said he was so upset by the restaurant's discriminatory policy that he threatened to call the police.

The staff then called the eatery's owner, who talked to the man and eventually allowed him to enter. The man who uploaded the photo described the sign as ""absolutely wrong, ignorant, xenophobic.""

The man then reasoned that all of humanity is at risk during the coronavirus crisis, foreign and Taiwanese alike. He argued that everyone should wear a mask and order takeout and that if the restaurant was really so concerned about the safety of its workers, it should shut down.

When asked for an explanation for the sign by Taiwan News, the restaurant claimed it had been created weeks ago because some customers from abroad had allegedly recently returned from overseas without staying under quarantine for the full 14 days as required. It stated that it posted the notice in response.

The restaurant wrote that the sign had been meant to enforce ""strict rules"" to ""protect public health,"" but it acknowledged it had been made without careful consideration and used a poor choice of English words, causing ""foreign friends to misunderstand."" The management then wrote that it has removed the announcement and again apologized to ""everyone.""

That same day, the restaurant posted an apology on its Facebook page, receiving a mixed reaction from followers. One person alleged that the policy was racist and ineffective, as many Taiwanese and other Asians who had recently traveled abroad would be allowed in.

Another person pointed out that the majority of the imported cases in Taiwan are actually Taiwanese citizens returning from countries hard-hit by the pandemic. Yet another said the restaurant's excuse of ""bad English"" was just an excuse to cover up its racist policy.

Some accepted the explanation, with one person thanking them for their apology and saying that they planned on visiting their store. Another called on the public to give them another chance given the ""extreme period"" that people are living in.

Although cases of discrimination have been far fewer and less extreme than has been seen in recent weeks in China, such as forced evictions and unwarranted quarantines of African residents in Guangzhou, there have been a few other incidents of discriminatory policies at restaurants, bars, and Airbnb rentals reported in Taiwan.

The majority of these establishments have changed their policies and apologized after receiving complaints from the foreign community, but some have stubbornly refused to end discriminatory policies, such as this Yakiniku restaurant and this Bistro, both of which still require foreigners to present their passports with the most recent entry stamp clearly visible.

If a foreigner encounters discrimination by a business in Taipei, they can file a report with Taipei Urbanism or petition the Taipei City Government. As for incidents outside of Taipei, it is advisable to contact local government authorities or email the Cabinet.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3924282

Taiwan is part of China,"" Roque said in the news report, commenting on an effort by the Philippine labor department to have the Filipina sent back to Manila.The department said the caregiver has been posting ""nasty and malevolent materials"" on social media in criticism of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's handling of the COVID-19 outbreak there.However, Ou said Wednesday that migrant workers in Taiwan enjoy the same freedom of expression as Taiwanese citizens, and if the Philippine government wants the caregiver deported, it can file a request via the proper diplomatic channels for judicial cooperation.Meanwhile, Angelito Banayo, chairman and resident representative of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei, told the media earlier in the day that he had not received any instructions from Manila to arrange for the caregiver's deportation.He also apologized for the wording of the controversial statement by the Philippine labor department, saying deportation is the sovereign privilege of the host country.The controversy over the Filipina caregiver followed another spat in February, when Philippines Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said ""Taiwan is part of China,"" as he announced the inclusion of Taiwan in a ban on arrivals from China as part of the effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.In response, MOFA asked for a retraction and said Taiwan would not rule out the possibility of taking ""corresponding measures"" against the Philippines if the ban was not lifted.

On Thursday morning (April 30), a European woman who is studying Mandarin in Taipei attempted to book an overnight stay at a temple on Lion Head Mountain in Miaoli County's Nanzhuang Township. However, she was told that foreigners are no longer allowed to stay in the temple due to the coronavirus outbreak.

She said her boyfriend, who works in Taiwan but is from another Asian country, speaks fluent Mandarin and thus this excludes the possibility there was a miscommunication due to the language barrier. He was told that only Taiwanese with a Taiwan ID card are permitted to stay.

When her boyfriend explained they have lived in Taiwan for two years, have Alien Resident Certificates (ARCs), and have not left Taiwan since February, he was still rebuffed. The woman who answered the phone insisted that because of the coronavirus outbreak, foreigners are currently not allowed to stay in the temple.

When questioned by Taiwan News, the woman claimed the temple was following ""government regulations"" in banning foreigners. When asked how they would screen Taiwanese visitors, she said they take their temperatures.

Given that Taiwan has seen no new cases for five days and no new domestic cases in 18 days, Taiwan News asked when the policy would end. She responded that, ""Everyone is going through a difficult time"" and that it is up to ""God"" to decide when the outbreak will end and thus make it safe for them to allow foreign guests.

This latest case of discrimination against foreigners comes on the heels of another incident, reported on Monday (April 27), in which a Taipei restaurant insisted that foreigners only order takeout while Taiwanese could dine in with a mask. In the case of the restaurant, after numerous foreigners posted complaints on its Facebook page, it rescinded the policy and issued an apology.

Although cases of discrimination have been far fewer and less extreme than what has been seen in recent weeks in China, where there have been forced evictions and unwarranted quarantines of African residents in Guangzhou, there have still been several other incidents of discriminatory policies at restaurants, bars, and Airbnb rentals reported in Taiwan.

The majority of these establishments have changed their policies and apologized after receiving complaints from the foreign community, but some have stubbornly refused to end discriminatory policies. They include this Yakiniku restaurant and this Bistro, both of which still require foreigners to present their passports, with the most recent entry stamp clearly visible.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) graced the May cover issue of American monthly The Diplomat for a feature looking back at her first term and ahead to her second and final term starting May 20, reports said Friday (May 1).

While Taiwan's leader has recently garnered attention due to her administration’s exemplary handling of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the online current-affairs magazine looks back at what it describes as the mixed record of her first term, beginning in May 2016.

The New Southbound Policy and the legalization of same-sex marriage amounted to highlights. However, confusion surrounding her labor and pension reforms resulted in turning the 2018 local elections into an “unmitigated disaster,” The Diplomat wrote.

Even so, her supporters’ hopes were high for a successful second term, according to the article titled “Tsai Ing-wen 2.0.”",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3926451

In a spirit of collaboration, the Holy See will donate 100,000 surgical face masks provided by Taiwan to certain African countries to help them combat the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, Taiwan's ambassador to the Vatican Matthew Lee (李世明) said Friday.

The masks are part of a donation of 200,000 masks donated by Taiwan to the Vatican, which arrived in the city-state along with two infrared thermal imaging cameras on Thursday, Lee told reporters during the handover ceremony.

The donation was accepted by Cardinal Peter Turkson, prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, and Binish Thomas Mulackal, director of the Vatican Pharmacy.

Mulackal asked the Taiwan Embassy to the Holy See whether Taiwan would agree to divert some of the donated masks to Africa, Lee said.

Turkson has also been in touch with the embassy to discuss ways to help Africa amid the pandemic after he was appointed by Pope Francis to head the Vatican's COVID-19 Commission in March, Lee further said.

According to Turkson, a cardinal from Ghana, the 100,000 masks will be delivered to Africa through Catholic charities such as Caritas.

""Taiwan is glad to collaborate with the Holy See in providing assistance to countries that need help the most,"" Lee stressed, adding that apart from the masks, Taiwan would also like to make other contributions to help contain the global spread of the coronavirus.

05/2/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Hopes for a run of seven days without any new Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) cases were dashed Saturday (May 2) when three new imported cases were announced, taking the total to 432.

The previous day, Taiwan recorded its sixth consecutive day without new cases. This raised expectations the virus was on the way out and the government could soon announce a relaxation of prevention measures.

Case No. 430 had traveled to Australia in February before flying to Japan in March, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said at its daily news conference. The individual felt feverish and started coughing on April 9, but even so returned to Taiwan on April 30.

The two other new cases were a couple who had traveled to Senegal for work on Feb. 11. As they felt unwell on April 26, they reported their conditions to the authorities before returning to Taiwan.

Media reports said they took off on an EVA Air flight from Paris on April 30 and arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport early Friday (May 1). No immediate confirmation from the airline was available.

Despite the three new cases, Taiwan has still achieved 20 days in a row without local transmissions, and the death toll remains at six. Meanwhile, 324 patients had been released from isolation after treatment at hospitals.

Saturday was the second day of the three-day Labor Day holiday period, with the authorities calling on travelers to wear masks and observe social distancing.

05/2/2020,"The annual Yilan International Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival has been canceled this year to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to the Yilan County government.

The festival, considered one of the biggest summer holiday attractions for families with children in northern Taiwan, was canceled due to considerations that the pandemic is still raging around the world with many international cities in lockdown, the county government said in a statement on Friday.

Yilan County Magistrate Lin Zi-miao (林姿妙) said the decision was made to cancel the festival, which was slated to be held between July and August, to safeguard the health of all visitors and international performance groups.

The festival is considered an international cultural exchange event that invites many children's folk performance troupes from around the world to perform there, she said.

Last year, the festival included performances by numerous international youth folk dance troupes, including ""Radist/Joy, Palace of Youth and Children in Vinnista"" from Ukraine, ""Utkarsh Dance Academy"" from India, ""The Folk Song and Dance Ensemble Sokolowianie"" from Poland, and ""Folk Dance Group Souvenir"" from Russia.

The festival aims to inspire children's creativity through the games and cultural experiences of different countries, according to its website.

Since its establishment in 1996, it has invited some 383 international performance groups from 98 countries and attracted over 10 million visitors, the International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folk Arts said.

The event was recognized as a qualified international festival by the council on Nov. 11, 2010, making it the fourth such festival in Asia to be certified by the council.

In the 24 years since its establishment, the festival was also canceled in 1998 due to fears of an enterovirus outbreak, in 2003 because of the SARS epidemic, and in 2008 and 2009 when it was replaced by the Yilan International Rain Festival.

05/2/2020,"Taipei, May 2 (CNA) Prosecutors filed an appeal Saturday after Chiayi District Court decided for a second time to commute the sentence of a man who fatally stabbed a railway police officer last July, on grounds of diminished responsibility.In the case in question, a 54-year-old passenger, surnamed Cheng (鄭), was detained on homicide charges after he fatally stabbed 24-year-old railway police officer Lee Cheng-han (李承翰) on a train from Tainan to Taipei on July 3, when he was found to lack a valid ticket.On Thursday, Chiayi District Court found Cheng innocent of murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to his long history of schizophrenia, which was documented by medical records going back to 2010 as well as a psychiatric assessment provided by an expert witness.Citing Article 19, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, which lists mental illness as possible grounds for commutation, the court ruled that Cheng could be released on NT$500,000 (US$16,819) bail and transferred to a secure facility, where he must undergo mental health treatment for five years.On Friday, government prosecutors appealed the decision to the Tainan Branch of the Taiwan High Court, which reversed and remanded the case back to the Chiayi District Court, ruling that giving Cheng the possibility of bail would risk creating panic and constituted a threat to public safety.Later that day, the Chiayi District Court issued a new sentence, which kept the terms of the original ruling in place but added seven conditions -- mainly pertaining to the terms of Cheng's detention and mandating regular psychiatric evaluations -- aimed at addressing the safety concerns in the High Court's ruling.The court reasoned that the conditions imposed were consistent with Article 87, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, which provides grounds for the forced detention of those found mentally unfit for punishment, if there is a fear of recidivism.However, the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office appealed the new decision, arguing that it set the bail too low for the severity of Cheng's crime and did not provide an absolute guarantee that he would not commit further acts of violence.Meanwhile, Cheng remains in regular detention as his family has said they are unable to pay the bail.The case has drawn significant attention from the Taiwanese media, which has resulted in a wave of public anger being directed against the expert witness whose evaluation of Cheng provided the grounds for his commutation.In a Facebook post Friday, Shen Cheng-che (沈正哲) defended his testimony, writing ""I made the assessment on the basis of my professional judgment, but I have no control over how the court ultimately decides to sentence the suspect.""Despite his sympathy for Lee's family, Cheng wrote, ""if the purpose is just to follow public opinion or societal expectations, then there's no reason to seek a doctor's assessment, and people can just decide the matter with an internet poll.""The court's rulings have also prompted a rare response from within Taiwan's government, as President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) on Friday indicated her support for an appeal, while Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) said he was ""shocked and disappointed"" by the decision.During an interview Saturday, New Power Party legislator Chiu Hsien-chih (邱顯智) suggested that at least two experts should determine a suspect's mental fitness in cases involving major crimes.Even autopsies must legally be carried out by two licensed coroners, Chiu, a former lawyer, pointed out.(By Chiang I-ching, Huang Guo-fang and Matthew Mazzetta) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005020012

The April figure dropped to its lowest in almost 10 years.Wu said although the main board returned to the 10,000 point mark, investors remain concerned by the virus spread, which is expected to create volatility in global markets.The sub-index on the likelihood of buying durable goods fell 6.9 from a month earlier to 97.55, while the sub-indexes on consumer prices and employment dropped 4.8 and 3.45, respectively, to 41.95 and 81.8 in April.According to NCU, the sub-index on employment fell to its lowest since July 2010, when the figure stood at 81.50 as the COVID-19 contagion forced many workers to take unpaid leave.In addition, the sub-indexes on family finances and the local economic climate also fell 3.4 and 2.55, respectively, to 88.55 and 86.40 in April.According to the NCU, a sub-index score of 0-100 indicates pessimism, while a score of 100-200 shows optimism.In other words, no factors in April's CCI indicated optimism for the next six months, the university said.The survey collected 2,847 valid questionnaires from local consumers aged 20 and over.

05/3/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Chang Shan-chwen (張上淳), the advisory specialist panel convener at Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), said on Sunday (May 3) that he expects the spread of Wuhan coronavirus to be slowed by the summer heat; however, he urged the public to remain cautious and observant, CNA reported.

In the past, influenza has typically broken out during the fall and winter seasons, with a comparatively low chance of it happening in summer, Chang said at the CECC daily press briefing. Therefore, he added, it's likely that the epidemic will taper off in the coming months, continuing that there is theoretical basis for the speculation.

Chang qualified his remarks by clarifying that although the above-mentioned view is valid for the temperate region, things may be different in the tropics.

The expert said he looks forward to seeing the virus lose potency with the rising temperatures. He made a point to urge continued caution, saying that prevention measures should still be rigorously practiced despite the heat, as at present there are many unknowns.

CECC Chief Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) urged the public to wash hands often, wear masks, keep social distancing, and check temperatures to avoid the possibility of a second spike in cases.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3927463

05/3/2020,"Taipei, May 3 (CNA) A coalition of migrant rights groups staged a rally in Taipei on Sunday, calling for Taiwan's labor ministry to improve migrant workers' rights and safety.About 50 people, including migrant workers and the representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), gathered outside the Ministry of Labor (MOL) to call for rules stipulating that dormitories must be located away from work sites in the interest of safety.A Filipino, identified only as Arturo, said that during the five years he worked at a metal production factory in Taoyuan, he was housed in the basement of the factory building with seven other coworkers.The cramped dorm space did not have proper ventilation and smelled of burning metal from the factory every morning, he said, adding that he and his workmates were afraid to sleep at night because they were worried about being trapped if a fire broke out.""There were no fire extinguishers and the stairs that led to the exit were very steep and narrow,"" said Arturo, whose right hand was severed in a work accident last year.Explaining the importance of separation, Hsu Wei-tung (許惟棟) of the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan cited three incidents in recent years, in which 11 migrant workers and six firefighters died in blazes that broke out at factories with dorms on the premises.In the most recent incident, three Vietnamese workers, who were housed in a dorm on the second floor of a metal manufacturing plant in Taichung, died when the factory went up in flames on March 22.""Their lives were lost because the dorm was not separate from the work place, so when the fire broke out in the factory, the dorm also went up in flames,"" said Hsu, urging the MOL to ensure dorms and factories are separate for the safety's sake.Meanwhile, an Indonesian caregiver, identified as Santi, called for the government to implement better rights for migrant caregivers because they are not protected under the Labor Standards Act.When she arrived in Taiwan in 2012, her salary was only NT$15,840 (US$529) per month, and after nine years of work experience, her wage has only increased to NT$17,000, Santi said.Her pay is relatively low compared to migrant factory workers who work eight hours and receive NT$23,800, she argued.""I work everyday from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and if the elderly patient I look after needs me after that, I still have to continue to work without rest,"" Santi lamented.The migrant workers at the rally, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, along with Taiwanese supporters, shouted slogans, and held up banners and placards in support of the demands presented to the MOL.According to the ministry, there are plans to amend the law to make it mandatory for employers of migrant workers to declare if there are any dangerous substances at work sites; and that groups who have concerns or suggestions will be invited to discuss the matter with related government agencies in the near future.With regards to migrant caregivers and domestic workers, their work contracts must state that the worker will be given enough rest time, such as one day off every seven days of work, according to the MOL.The terms of salaries have already been discussed with the government in the workers' country of origin, the ministry said.As of the end of March there were 718,531 migrant workers in Taiwan, with 455,580 working in productive industries and 262,951 in the social welfare sector, according to MOL statistics.(By William Yen) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005030006

05/3/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A nightclub in Taichung City on Thursday (April 30) announced a new policy that foreign residents are complaining is discriminatory, as it only requires foreigners to provide proof they have been in the country longer than 14 days, while not asking Taiwanese to do the same.

On its foreign relations Facebook page, a nightclub in Taichung's Nantun District on Thursday evening announced a new policy to screen guests for symptoms and travel history to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The announcement stated the club would not accept customers who have a constant cough, a fever or temperature over 37.5 degrees Celsius, and have returned from abroad within 14 days, or come into contact with a person who has.

It then listed an additional condition directed solely at ""non-Taiwanese citizens"" wishing to enter the club. The club is now requiring all foreign nationals to present a passport with the most recent entry stamp, before they will be allowed inside.



Nightclub's new policy requires foreigners to present travel documents. (Facebook screenshot)

Foreign residents who have not recently traveled abroad are required to present an entry/exit date certificate issued by the National Immigration Agency. However, the notice does not state any similar requirement for Taiwanese citizens, instead leaving it to some sort of honor code on their part.

The timing of the policy is odd given that Taiwan has gone 21 days without a single local case of the coronavirus. On March 19, Taiwan banned all foreign visitors, with few exceptions, and the ban is still in place to this day.

The last time a foreign national was diagnosed with the disease in Taiwan was case No. 229, an American male in his 30s returning from the U.S, on March 25. Since that day, 100 percent of Taiwan's domestic and imported cases have been Taiwanese.

All people arriving in Taiwan from abroad must undergo 14 weeks of home quarantine. If they are already presenting symptoms, do not have the means pay to stay in a hotel for 14 days, or have family members at high risk, they must enter a government-provided quarantine center.

That same evening, the administrator of the Facebook Group Taichung Info Exchange posted the club's announcement on the group. She then included screenshots of her correspondence with the foreign relations representative for the club.

She asked the representative why foreigners are required to provide proof of their travel history while Taiwanese are not. The representative refused to answer the question and exhorted her to ""not bring up some discrimination subject here,"" and glibly welcomed ""whoever wants to drink and have fun.""

Out of Taiwan's 432 confirmed cases of coronavirus, only 15 are foreign nationals, including three Chinese citizens from Wuhan, China. The nightclub has yet to respond to two requests by Taiwan News to explain why the travel document policy is only directed at foreign nationals.

Although cases of discrimination have been far fewer and less extreme than what has been seen in recent weeks in China, where there have been forced evictions and unwarranted quarantines of African residents in Guangzhou, there have been several other cases of discriminatory policies at restaurants, bars, temples, nightclubs, and Airbnb rentals reported in Taiwan.

The majority of these establishments have changed their policies and apologized after receiving complaints from the foreign community, but some have stubbornly refused to end discriminatory policies. These include a temple, yakiniku restaurant, bistro, gym, and bar which either require foreigners to present their passports or refuse entry to foreigners entirely.

According to the report, Ching Sheng Hotel, run by Wenwu Temple, will close on May 26 and lay off 24 employees. Wen Wu Temple Chairman Chang De-lin (張德林) said on Sunday the hotel has lost more than NT$10 million (US$330,000) over the past four years.

He added the situation had been exacerbated by a big decline in the number of Chinese coming to Taiwan. The hotel will be closed to prevent further losses, CNA quoted Chang as saying. An employee said the hotel is set to shutter on May 26.

Meanwhile, Tayih Landis Hotel, the first five-star hotel in Tainan, has reportedly decided to shutter on June 30. Hotel owner Tayih Group rented the building from the building owner, Cathay Life Insurance, and opened the hotel in 2002.

A total of 251 hotel employees will be laid off when the hotel closes its doors on June 30, CNA reported. The rental contract between the two parties will be terminated earlier than originally agreed upon, the report said.

The hotel is located in an area where many upscale hotels compete against each other. Seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Tayih Landis Hotel’s business plummeted.

An anonymous hotel employee said that occupancy rates during holidays could reach 70 percent, but the rates would drop to 30 percent at regular times. The employee believed the same held true for other hotels.

According to the city’s tourism bureau, there are 260 hotels and 332 bed and breakfasts in the city. Their occupancy rates dropped by 10-20 percent in February and by 30-40 percent in March due to the pandemic. Hotels located in the city’s downtown area fared better, with occupancy rates reaching over 70 percent during holidays and weekends, the report said.

The announcement states that masks are mandatory for all customers and that the club would not accept anyone with a temperature over 37.5 degrees Celsius.

It also says that all guests must present a photo ID and fill out a ""Health Declaration"" form. It adds that anyone who has traveled abroad within the past 14 days will be denied entry.

The fourth and most controversial item on the list requires all ""foreign guests"" to present an ""actual passport"" before entering. However, the notice does not state any similar requirement for Taiwanese citizens, instead leaving it to some sort of honor code.

The notice also does not give an explanation of how foreign e-gate users could prove their last entry date. It goes on to ask people waiting in line to practice social distancing but does not say anything about continuing such distancing once inside the club.

The announcement closes by stating that the establishment will refuse entry to anyone required to be under quarantine. It then threatens legal action against any quarantine violators who cause loss of business or damage in reputation to the club.

In the letter, titled ""Include Taiwan in the fight against COVID-19,"" Chen pointed out that Taiwan is one of the countries that have effectively curbed the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and minimized their death toll. He mentioned that the SARS outbreak in 2003 taught Taiwan a lesson, leading to the establishment of the island nation's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), which has proven to be critical in the coronavirus battle.

Chen exclaimed that ""Diseases know no bounds"" and said it is important for Taiwan to be admitted into the WHO in order to share its experiences and knowledge about the ongoing pandemic. He added that Taiwan is very willing to cooperate with all countries and fulfill its duty as a member of the global community.

The health minister further stated that Taiwan should not be excluded from global health conversations and urged the WHO to consider granting the East Asian nation permission to participate in all important meetings. He added that there should be no gap in global health security due to political reasons, stressing the WHO should ""leave no one behind.""

Chen said he hoped the WHO would stick to its mission of ""ensuring the highest achievable health standard for all people"" as well as acknowledge Taiwan's contributions to the world. He also promised that the Taiwanese government would continue to work towards securing the fundamental human right to health for citizens of every country.

05/5/2020,"Taipei, May 5 (CNA) Taiwan's two major fuel suppliers, state-run CPC Corp., Taiwan and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPCC), both reported computer hacks over the past two days, though their systems have since returned to normal.FPCC said Tuesday that an employee reported irregularities on a computer in the morning, and the company responded by shutting down computers in all divisions.After an inspection, FPCC found that the computer was infected with a virus, though no data was lost and company operations were not affected.The company was on high alert because CPC had been hacked a day earlier, it said.On Monday, CPC said its computer system had been infected with ransomware, which caused payment issues at gas stations.CPC successfully re-launched its system later that day, and said it will monitor records to determine the origin of the attack.Other than temporary payment issues, the company's operations were unaffected by the hack, it said.In response to the attacks, Taiwan's Investigation Bureau said it had obtained a copy of the ransomware, which it is analyzing.As these kinds of malicious software usually force people to pay ransom to a cryptocurrency account, the bureau will cooperate with international law enforcement agencies to establish the source of the attack, it said.The bureau will also look into the hack at FPCC, it said, adding that so far there is not enough information to confirm whether the two hacks were connected.According to Chien Sheng-tsai (簡勝財), a senior consultant at online security software developer Trend Micro Inc., the hacks are likely to continue until the hackers achieve their purpose.In past ransomware cases, hackers repeatedly attacked their target in order to extort payment. If the first attempt fails, they launched a second or third wave of attacks, Chien said.He suggested that companies build up multiple layers of protection for their computer systems and be aware of hacks that can happen through email or websites.Chien also stressed the importance of a thorough investigation when a hack occurs.Because hackers attack multiple computers at once, it is crucial to find out how they were able to obtain access and what information they have in order to prevent future hacks, he said.Meanwhile, Powertech Technology Inc., one of Taiwan's leading integrated circuit packaging and testing service providers, also said on Tuesday it had been hacked.Some of the company's computer servers in a factory in Hsinchu were infected by ransomware on Monday, and they worked with information security experts to remove it, Powertech said.The affected servers have since been restored, and company data was unaffected, the company said.According to national security officials, these attacks are not individual cases, but routine attacks on democratic countries like Taiwan intended to paralyze our systems.In the past, the sources of such attacks have included countries like Russia and China, they said, and the most recent hacks could be trial runs before President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) inauguration on May 20.(By Tsai Peng-min, Hsiao Po-wen, Wu Chia-hao, Chung Jung-feng and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005050025

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Using the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as a window of opportunity to attack Taiwan would be too costly and damage the more important goal of national rejuvenation, according to a retired Chinese general known as a hawk.

With his comments, military strategist Qiao Liang (喬良) went against the current tide of ultra-nationalism in China, according to a report in Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post on Monday (May 4).

He said the country’s ultimate goal, a good life for 1.4 billion Chinese people, would not be served by launching an attack against Taiwan, so the island should not be Beijing’s top priority.

Even if an offensive by the People’s Liberation Army might not lead to a declaration of war by the United States, the latter might still join forces with its allies in the region to impose damaging economic sanctions and cut off China’s maritime lifeline in the South China Sea, according to statements by Qiao on the country’s social media.

The retired Air Force major general also unexpectedly named Taiwan as not exclusively a “Chinese domestic issue.” The island is a key problem between the U.S. and China, and can only be resolved if the rivalry between Washington and Beijing is also resolved, the South China Morning Post quoted Qiao as saying.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan professional baseball (CPBL) will become the first majors in the world to bring fans back into the stadium on Friday (May 8), after the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) confirmed a maximum of 1,000 fans will be allowed in each of the two games scheduled that day.

After being the first baseball league to open its 2020 season worldwide, the CPBL has sought approval from the CECC to allow spectators back into the seats. Since the season began on April 12, the teams have been playing behind closed-doors with cardboard cut-outs and dummies standing in for the crowd.

The games have also been broadcast live in English and have attracted a lot of international attention. Media outlets, including the New York Times and Reuters, have praised the Taiwanese sports league for its pandemic prevention measures as well as the country's overall success in containing the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).

During a daily press conference on Wednesday, Health Minister and CECC head Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) announced that 1,000 spectators each will be allowed to enjoy Friday's games in person at the Xinzhuang Stadium in New Taipei City and the Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in Taichung. Chen said fans must have their temperatures taken, wear face masks and maintain 1.5 meters of social distancing, reported Yahoo News.

CPBL Secretary-General Fong Sheng-shien (馮勝賢) said the league was delighted to welcome back fans, who he stressed are an indispensable part of baseball. He expressed gratitude to the CECC's leadership and said the teams will make sure to implement necessary measures to ensure everyone's safety, reported CNA.

According to Liberty Times, the CPBL originally proposed to let 250 people into each stadium, but the maximum attendance cap has since been increased due to Taiwan having gone 24 straight days without recording a single local case of coronavirus. As of Wednesday afternoon, the country has 439 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 339 of which have been released from hospital isolation.

05/6/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As Mother's Day nears in Taiwan, a local women's group is pointing out that discrimination against working mothers is still very real, with 8 percent of women in the country not returning to their jobs after parental leave.

According to a recent poll, the main reason for Taiwanese women remaining out of the workforce after giving birth is that their jobs have often been taken by the time they are ready to return.

Taiwan is doing better with gender equality in the workplace than other Asian nations, but the Garden of Hope Foundation drew attention on Wednesday (May 6) to the reality that the gender wage gap and glass ceiling, however improved, still remain serous issues in the country.

Women in Taiwan tend to take primary responsibility for childcare; up to 83 percent of those who took parental leave in 2018 were women.

After returning to the workplace, working women still tend to take on the bulk of household chores and childcare duties. While grappling with these stressful conditions, working mothers may also have to contend with coworkers who are unsympathetic to their underpaid and overworked plight, according to another survey by a job bank.

There are, however, some companies that are dedicated to eliminating the gender wage gap and creating a workplace friendly to women and mothers. Diageo Taiwan Inc., for example, has since 2018 been offering training for its female workers in frontline sales to protect themselves from sexual harassment; this year, the company continued to advocate for gender equality in the workplace with more training, better parental leave (26 weeks of full-pay), and strong female participation in leadership roles.

Outside of its offices, the company continues to sponsor initiatives to empower women in Taiwan in keeping with the United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles.

In 2013, Diageo Taiwan funded a three-year program encouraging female immigrants to the country to learn Mandarin Chinese as well as Taiwanese culture while developing skills to advance their careers. In recent years, Diageo funded events and campaigns to raise awareness of women's issues and improve workplace communication surrounding these important matters.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3929304

Taiwan (中油) and privately-owned Formosa Petrochemical Corp.

In a press conference, Adimmune announced that experiments on rats have shown the animals to be in possession of strong antibodies after being injected with the vaccine. The company is aiming to begin human trials in the second half of the year, per CNA.

The success of these tests depends on whether the animals develop enough antibodies, he added.

Even if they were to develop the antibodies, Chang said, hurdles would still linger in the path to successful vaccine development, like possible side effects and toxicology; therefore, more tests are required. Only when these hurdles are cleared can human trials be allowed to take place, so it takes time, he added.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Mandopop superstar Jay Chou is bringing a little magic into viewers’ lives with his Netflix show “J-Style Trip.”

Part travelogue, part magic performance, the show has Chou diving into adventures around the world with his A-lister friends.

“Magic is actually like music. It is a universal language,” Chou told The Associated Press in Taiwan recently.

Chou and his friends take their magic tricks everywhere – from Pompidou in Paris to a local food court in Singapore – taking homebound viewers on virtual trips amid pandemic shutdowns.

“I wanted to show the warmness and friendliness of people around the world, and how people connect with each other in different ways,” Chou said.

Each episode features a special guest like Taiwanese singer Jam Hsiao, Singaporean singer Wayne Lim Junjie, better known as JJ Lin, and classical pianist Lang Lang.

Chou’s especially excited about Lang Lang’s upcoming appearance. “Lang Lang, in fact, is a very humorous and really fun person,” Chou said of the classical superstar who has a whopping 15 million followers on his social media.

He couldn’t resist giving a sneak peek, revealing that Lang Lang will show up in hip-hop attire and fake mustache to surprise people.

Meanwhile, the singer-songwriter has another surprise in stored for his fans.

“I haven’t released any albums for a very long time. That’s because I have been spending more time with my family,” said Chou, who got married in 2015 and has two children.

Chou recently updated his Instagram with a picture of piano painting by German artist Albert Oehlen.

“I’ve started producing,” the caption said, with a piano emoji. Chou confirmed that he’s working on new songs. “I know my fans are excited. Seems like everyone’s been waiting for a long time,” Chou said.

“Many people think my past songs are great and can’t be surpassed,"" Chou said. He thinks his songs, albeit similar in some ways, cannot be compared because people project their own “memories” to each track.

With more than 10 albums, Chou, who describes himself as “workaholic,” is still leveling up.

“I always feel like only I can outperform myself!”

05/6/2020,"Taipei, May 6 (CNA) A Spanish man wanted for sexual assault in Italy and being sought through an Interpol red notice has been deported from Taiwan as the result of police cooperation between Taiwan and Italy, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Wednesday.Taiwan police were asked for their help after being informed by their Italian counterparts in 2018 that the 35-year-old fugitive, wanted for sexual misconduct and other crimes in Italy 10 years ago, had gone into hiding in Taiwan for six years.Taiwanese law enforcement authorities then formed a task force and invited Italian police liaison officers for discussions in Taiwan on a joint operation to crack the case.After an investigation, police discovered that the Spanish man, named Juan Texta, had set up a company in Italy several years ago but was sentenced to six years and two months in prison on charges of sexual assault of employees and kidnapping in 2010, the CIB said.Texta then fled Italy to live abroad to evade capture. He first came to Taiwan in March 2013 on a visitor visa and returned again in April 2014 on a student visa, after which he went into hiding in Taoyuan in northern Taiwan.In his earlier period in Taiwan, Texta rented an apartment in Taoyuan and worked as a disc jockey at a night club. However, he was sentenced to two months in prison and prohibited from leaving the country in 2014 when his electric bicycle caught fire and injured some passersby. That conviction was confirmed in January this year.After a period of surveillance and monitoring, police arrested Texta at his Taoyuan residence on Feb. 11 and deported him from Taiwan April 24 after he had served his jail term here, according to the CIB.Due to the suspension of flights between Taiwan and Italy because of the COVID-19 corona pandemic, the CIB escorted Texta to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris on April 25, from where he was extradited to Italy by Interpol.Interpol red notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. It is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and detain anyone pending extradition or similar legal action.(By Huang Li-yun and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005060023
05/6/2020,"Taipei, May 6 (CNA) The Water Resources Agency (WRA) said Wednesday it is planning to artificially increase the rainfall when a weather front passes through Taiwan next week, as water levels have been low in many of the country's reservoirs.The WRA is preparing to use ground-based cloud-seeding techniques, which involve burning non-toxic agents, in an attempt to increase the rainfall near several reservoirs in Taiwan on May 10 and 11, WRA Deputy Director-General Wang Yi-feng (王藝峰) said.On Tuesday, the WRA attempted artificial rainmaking at several reservoirs but was unsuccessful because the weather conditions were not optimal, he said.The particles released during the burning process can only be carried up to the clouds to trigger rain if the air circulation is stable, powerful and continuous, which was not the case on Tuesday, Wang said.Currently, at the end of the dry season in Taiwan, reservoirs in the central and southern areas of the country are at low levels, as there has been no heavy rainfall in those regions since last October, according to Wang.As of 6 p.m. Wednesday, Zengwen Reservoir, one of the major reservoirs in the south, was at about 9.81 percent capacity, with the water level at 230 meters, while Nanhua Reservoir in that region was at 16.69 percent capacity, WRA data showed.The only reservoir in the south at more than 50 percent capacity was Wushantou Reservoir, according to the data.(By Wu Po-wei and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005060021

She immediately underwent a swab test for COVID-19 and was then sent to a quarantine center, Chen said.The test results came back negative, and the woman was transferred to a quarantine hotel on April 27, Chen said.While isolated at the hotel, the woman had persistent nasal congestion and a runny nose and experienced an abnormal sense of taste.She contacted health authorities on May 4, and they arranged a new COVID-19 test for her that came back positive on Wednesday, the CECC said.Because she stayed isolated at the hotel, she did not come into contact with her relatives and friends, but the CECC said it will still trace passengers who were on the flight with the woman to see if any of them have symptoms.To date, 348 of Taiwan's 439 cases have been classified as imported, while 55 are believed to be local infections, according to CECC statistics.The other 36 are military personnel who were serving on the Panshi fast combat support ship, part of a goodwill fleet that visited Palau from March 12 to 15. The CECC has yet to confirm whether their infections were local or imported.Taiwan has not recorded any locally transmitted cases since April 12, according to the CECC data.So far, 339 COVID-19 patients in Taiwan have recovered, six have died, and the others remain in the hospital, the CECC said.Meanwhile, 229 Taiwanese nationals evacuated from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak, on April 21 have been released from their 14-day quarantine.Another 129 Taiwanese who returned from India on Tuesday morning and tested negative for the virus are in a dedicated quarantine center.Globally, COVID-19 has infected 3,694,516 people in 186 countries and regions, including 1,223,080 in the U.S., 219,329 in Spain, 213,013 in Italy, 204,659 in France, and 194,990 in the United Kingdom, with a total of 256,137 fatalities, according to CECC statistics as of Wednesday.(By Evelyn Kao) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005060013
05/7/2020,"Taipei, May 7 (CNA) Taiwan is considering changing its current entry regulations for its citizens who contracted the COVID-19 coronavirus abroad, making it mandatory for them to meet certain health criteria, the Central Epidemic Commend Center (CECC) said Thursday.Under a plan being drafted by the CECC, Taiwanese who contract COVID-19 in another country would be allowed to return home if they have recovered, which means they have had two consecutive negative tests or have not had any symptoms of the disease for at least two months since the onset, CECC spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) told CNA.That condition was proposed in a recent meeting of CECC experts, in response to requests by some Taiwanese who were infected abroad and wish to return to Taiwan, said Chuang, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control.The CECC is also considering implementing regulations regarding Taiwanese travelers who have a fever, as the current rules set by the airlines do not allow passengers with a temperature to board their flights to Taiwan, Chuang said.He said that regulation is too harsh, since a fever alone does not necessarily mean the person has COVID-19.Chuang said it is difficult for Taiwanese in some other countries to get tested for COVID-19 and to obtain medical treatment if they contract the disease.The new plan, which includes other aspects of Taiwan's current entry regulations, is still in the draft stage, and no date has yet been set for its finalization, he said.If the plan is implemented, however, testing of returning Taiwanese will still be required, along with the mandatory 14-day quarantine after arrival, Chuang said.Those who were diagnosed overseas with COVID-19 will have to present a doctor's certificate, while those with suspicious symptoms will be asked to adhere to the current rules, which require completion of a health declaration at the airline counter in the country of departure and reporting to quarantine officers upon arrival in Taiwan, Chuang said.Failure to comply may result in a fine of up to NT$150,000 (US$5,000), he warned.As of Thursday, Taiwan had 440 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 349 classified as imported, 55 as locally acquired, and 36 as part of a cluster infection on a Navy ship that returned to Taiwan April 9 from a goodwill mission.Among Taiwan's 440 cases, six have died, while 347 have recovered, and the others are still in hospital, according to CECC data.(By Flor Wang and Chen Wei-ting) Enditem/pc",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005070015
05/7/2020,"Coronavirus restrictions imposed on restaurants could soon be relaxed Coronavirus restrictions imposed on restaurants could soon be relaxed (CNA photo)

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As Taiwan recorded 25 consecutive days without domestic coronavirus transmissions Thursday (May 7), officials said that restrictions imposed on restaurants to reduce the risk of infections may soon be relaxed.

While the restaurants should still respect social distancing and keep tables and customers apart, measures about the use of common chopsticks and other utensils could soon be relaxed, CNA quoted a spokesman for the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) as saying.

Any relaxation will also be dependent on the behavior of customers and of the public at large, officials added. If members of the public continue to wear face masks, respect social distancing, wash hands frequently, and stay at home when feeling ill, then it will be possible to advance toward fewer restrictions, the CNA report said.

Amid the infection slowdown, hotels across Taiwan have already been launching new promotional plans to attract domestic tourists, though foreign travelers are still barred from entering the country, unless they hold residency permits.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3929798
05/7/2020,"Taipei, May 7 (CNA) A rapid antibody test kit for COVID-19 developed by a local biomedical company that can deliver results in just 10 minutes has passed clinical trials and is ready for mass production, a company official said Thursday.The rapid test kit for the detection of antibodies of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been validated by a comprehensive clinical study conducted by National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). The test boasts 100 percent sensitivity and 95 percent specificity, said Cooky Chen (陳作範), chairman of Excelsior Bio-System, Inc., at an event for the presentation of the results.The method of testing is similar to that of a pregnancy test, which uses two red lines to indicate results. Two lines indicate that the test is positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which usually means people have had COVID-19, according to project manager Hsieh Szu-min (謝思民), an infectious disease specialist from NTUH.Through the clinical trials, the hospital provides references to the company, including methods of execution and conducting of the testing, and offers SARS-CoV-2-positive patient samples and negative samples it has collected during the pandemic for a double-blind study to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the test, Hsieh said.The test kit was successful in detecting antibodies in 13 COVID-19 patients, Hsieh said, adding that the test therefore has a sensitivity of 100 percent.The kit can be used for rapid screening of carriers of the virus who may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic, said Lee Yu-chun (李宇群), the head of the company's testing kit development division.Lee added, however, that because patients do not produce antibodies to the virus during the initial stages of infection, the antibody test can miss the early stages of infection and should be used in conjunction with the COVID-19 antigen rapid testing technology.It usually takes 8-10 months for the development of a rapid testing kit, but this time, the rapid antibody test kit has been developed much more quickly, since the research team only launched the project in mid-February.The kit was sent to the Health Ministry on May 5 for approval and is ready to be put into mass production, Chen said, adding that the company plans to produce 400,000 tests per month and introduce fully automated packaging lines for the product in the second half of this year to meet strong demand at home and from abroad amid the global pandemic.(By Wu Hsin-yun and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005070013

The proposal is seen as sensitive because it comes just weeks ahead of Tsai’s May 20 swearing-in for her second and final four-year term as president. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate won a landslide victory in the Jan. 11 presidential election.

DPP legislator Tsai Yi-yu (蔡易餘), who is not related to the president, said the current wording of the act describing “national unification” as the only aim no longer reflects the political reality and should therefore be removed from the text, the China Times reported.

His proposal passed its first reading at the Legislative Yuan Friday morning, leading the China Times to describe it as a step toward Taiwan Independence. The text of the act opens with the phrase “before the unification of the nation,” which the legislator wants to replace with “in response to national development,” the newspaper reported.

05/8/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — In apparent deference to Beijing, Canada's foreign minister on Thursday (May 7) twice avoided mentioning Taiwan's name when asked to thank the country for donating over 500,000 masks.

During a virtual meeting of Canada's House of Commons on Thursday, Conservative MP Ed Fast pointed out that Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne had sent out a tweet on March 28 to thank China for donating PPE to Canada just three hours after Beijing made the announcement. Fast then noted that much of this equipment was later found to be defective and could not be used.

In contrast, Fast noted that a full two weeks after Taiwan had donated 500,000 surgical masks to Canada, the foreign minister had yet to publicly thank the country for its contribution. Fast then asked Champagne if he would thank this ""free and democratic country for its generous gift to Canadians?""

Champagne immediately ducked the question by saying ""We are grateful to every nation for helping Canada."" He continued to speak in general terms: ""We have been expressing our thanks to many nations who have contributed.""

The foreign minister then chastised his colleague for bringing up the question, saying: ""It is important at [a] time of pandemic that we don't play politics."" Champagne then spoke of a broad need for ""humanity to come together"" and to ""work with every nation when it comes to health.""

Dissatisfied with Champagne's cagey reply, Fast added that on May 4, Taiwan delivered 25,000 medical masks to the government of British Columbia. He informed the foreign minister that local government officials thanked Taiwan for the masks that day.

He then pressed Champagne a second time, asking ""Again, will the minister now do the right thing and on the behalf of Canadians recognize the generosity of Taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation?"" Repeating his earlier tactic, Champagne said Canada is grateful to ""all who have given supplies"" and that we are ""grateful to every nation . . . for all those who have agreed to help Canada and Canadians from coast to coast.""

When asked by Global News about Champagne's failure to thank Taiwan directly, his spokesperson said that International Trade Minister Mary Ng on Thursday would call Taiwan Economic Affairs Minister Shen Jong-chin (沈榮津) to ""reiterate Canada’s thanks for this donation.""

05/8/2020,"Taipei, May 8 (CNA) Calls by some ""left-leaning"" legislators in Paraguay, Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in South America, to shift formal ties to Beijing are opposed by public opinion in the country, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday, reiterating the long-standing friendship between the two countries.According to the latest issue of Americas Quarterly, published on May 7, the Paraguayan Senate took a vote on April 17 in a virtual session on whether to urge the president to change diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.Confirming the report, MOFA spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) said seven Paraguayan senators associated with the left-leaning party caucus ""Frente Guazú"" petitioned on March 30 to establish formal ties with Beijing in exchange for medical supplies from China and direct access to China's market.The 45-seat Paraguayan Senate voted against the proposal, 25-16, on April 17, with four absent, Ou said in a statement, adding that the ministry is closely watching developments.""We respect the democratic process in Paraguay. The Taiwan Embassy in Paraguay will continue to actively seek communication with the country's opposition and to dispel doubts on the benefits of retaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan,"" she said.""The 'Frente Guazú' has long proposed closer ties with leftist regimes such as China, Venezuela and Cuba, but the proposition does not conform to public sentiment in Paraguay,"" Ou said.MOFA speculated that some Paraguay legislators may have been influenced by China's ""grand propaganda"" strategy amid the COVID-19 pandemic and they perhaps expect too much from such ""elaborate but unrealistic aid"" offered by Beijing.Taiwan has donated medical equipment and supplies, including face masks and infrared thermal imaging cameras to help Paraguay in its fight against the coronavirus, according to the ministry, adding that Taiwan will continue to find ways to help Asunción.MOFA also said all cooperation projects between the two countries are proceeding smoothly and vowed to deepen relations with Paraguay in every field.Paraguay is one of the 15 countries in the world that maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan and the only one in South America. Media reports said Beijing has donated more than 40,000kg of medical goods to Paraguay recently and used such donations as leverage to encourage the country to switch sides.According to a press release from Paraguay's Chamber of Deputies, legislators approved on April 20 the postponement of debate on an initiative to support Taiwan's participation in this year's World Health Assembly, with some legislators arguing such discussions were not appropriate at a time when Paraguay is receiving medical goods from China.(By Emerson Lim) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005080015

The countries receiving the letters ranged from prominent European nations such as Great Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy, via India and Pakistan to most countries in East Asia, including Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore, CNA reported.

As the whole world fights the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it was more important than ever to put global health above politics, the message said. Taiwan was described as “a reliable partner” able to provide important resources to global healthcare, yet the WHO and China have restricted the island nation’s access to the health community.

“Such blatant prioritization of Beijing’s political interests over the health and safety of Taiwan and the rest of the world has grave consequences,” the message warned. The members of Congress emphasized that “diseases know no borders” and that United Nations members should insist that Taiwan is allowed to join the virtual WHA meeting scheduled for this month.

The letter bore the signatures of Eliot Engel, the Democrat who chairs the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee; Michael McCaul, the group’s ranking Republican member; Senator Jim Risch, the Republican who chairs the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee; and Bob Menendez, the panel’s ranking Democrat, according to a Reuters report.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3931004

Ma made the comment after Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers proposed removing some words from the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area to line up with reality.

The proposed amendment, led by DPP lawmaker Tsai Yi-yu (蔡易餘), wants to delete ""before national unification"" along with several other phrases. These are said to be the product of a mutual misconception between the Chinese Communist Party and Taiwan's Nationalist Party at the time it was implemented in 1992, one suggesting both sides will one day reunify.

The wording does not conform to today's political reality that Taiwan is an independent nation by the definition of international law. China thinks otherwise.

The lawmakers who proposed the changes said they should be based on the actual need for national development, according to a media report. ""Whether the country opts for reunification, independence, or the status quo, it should be determined by all Taiwanese,"" Tsai said.

The bill passed its first reading on Friday (May 8) and is slated for review by the Internal Administration Committee.

However, China sees the proposed amendment as a provocative attempt to challenge its bottom line. Ma described it as ""extremely dangerous"" and warned of a worst-case scenario for those trying to separate Taiwan from China ""in any format.""

Instead, it will be held inside the Taipei Guest House, a short distance away on Ketagalan Road, the spokesman said.

Foreign diplomats stationed in Taiwan will still be invited to attend the speech, expected to start at 10 a.m., according to the CNA report.

While health officials remain cautiously optimistic about the development, Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) has hinted measures are on the horizon to revive tourism, which has been one of the sectors hardest-hit by the crisis. The plan will be implemented in three phases when the country reports no local infections for a full month, he said Sunday, according to Newtalk.

The first stage will focus on collaboration with industry players to ensure the vigorous practice of infection prevention. Experts will be tasked with designing itineraries and conducting examinations of tourist attractions to gauge their preparedness.

Next will come incentives to entice travelers by providing citizens with subsidies of NT$1,000 (U$33) for individual travel and NT$6,000 for group travel. The details of the deals have yet to be determined, Lin said. The third phase will be a campaign to attract international travelers to Taiwan.

As the coronavirus rages, Taiwan has seen a plunge in the number of arrivals and departures during the first quarter of 2020. From January through March, 3,615,349 people arrived in Taiwan, and 3,552,631 flew out of the country, a sharp decline compared to the same period last year when 7,043,654 arrivals and 7,152,826 departures were logged.

Singapore has rolled out an audit initiative that certifies hotels and other tourism establishments that meet the criteria for safe travel post-coronavirus. Those that meet the requirements will receive an “SG Clean” stamp that gives visitors “peace of mind,” Business Insider quoted Singapore Tourism Board CEO Keith Tan as saying.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3931400
05/10/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan Taxi Co. on Sunday (May 10) announced that it would provide NT$2.5 million (US$83,700) to frontline medical workers to use as taxi vouchers as a way of showing appreciation for the unsung heroes of the coronavirus pandemic.

During the ""Taiwan Taxi Can Help"" (醫護挺我，我挺醫護) event held at the Taipei Hospital Sunday morning, Taiwan Taxi Chairman Gary Lin (林村田) pointed out that the company would like to ""buy"" more rest time for the medical workers who have dedicated the last five months to ensuring the country's safety. He said that the medical teams have not had adequate rest since January, which Taiwan Taxi hopes to give them via the vouchers.

Lin stressed that taxi drivers in Taiwan have been hugely affected by the pandemic as well, with the industry experiencing a sharp decline in customer numbers. However, he said the company has still decided to inject some warmth into society by supporting medical workers — a move he hopes other enterprises will follow, reported New Talk.

Since Sunday is Mother's Day, Taiwan Taxi is also gifting bouquets of carnations to Taipei Hospital. Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) and Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) were also present at the ceremony.

Chen told those assembled that many frontline health workers would be unable to spend the day with their mothers and children because they are busy trying to protect the country. However, he said that the contributions of these people have yielded promising results, which he believes mothers around the world are extremely thankful for, reported UDN.

TPO was acquired by flat panel maker Innolux Corp. in 2010.Sources close to the investment plan said the new plant will be built on a 30.83 hectare plot as part of the second phase of the Longtan section.While sources in the science park bureau declined to disclose any financial terms or product details about the new investment plan, the Taiwan-based Chinese language Economic Daily News reported earlier Monday that the investment is expected to be about NT$10 billion (US$334 million).The report said Apple is likely to pour several billion Taiwan dollars into the initial phase of the investment plan to boost next generation monitor production as well as engage in monitor research and development.The sources at the science park indicated that Taiwan's Apple branch currently develops low temperature poly-silicon displays and metal-oxide-semiconductor screens along with quantum film image sensors.The newspaper cited unnamed sources as saying the Longtan investment plan has been listed as a classified top project by Apple, adding that the U.S. brand values the investment plan highly and has dispatched an R&D team to Taiwan to facilitate the investment.According to the report, Apple is planning to team up with Taiwan-based LED lighting maker Epistar Corp. and flat panel maker AU Optornics Corp. in monitor development in a bid to reduce the company's dependence on Japanese and South Korean suppliers.The report said Apple has had a lab in Longtan since 2014 and with the new investment, the company aims to roll out Mini LED and Micro LED related displays.The report added that the Longtan plant is expected to become the third overseas R&D hub for Apple after Japan and South Korea.(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005110015

05/11/2020,"Taipei, May 11 (CNA) There is ""no crisis"" regarding Taiwan's diplomatic ties with Paraguay, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) said Monday after a number of senators in Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in South America recently voted in favor of changing diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.""Paraguay has long been a strong supporter of Taiwan, since both of our countries are democratic nations, so it is perfectly normal that there are different voices within the country (on whether to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan),"" Wu told reporters on the sidelines of a legislative session.Wu made the remarks when asked to comment on an April 17 vote by the Paraguayan Senate in a virtual session on whether to urge the country's president to switch diplomatic recognition to China.The 45-seat Paraguayan Senate voted against the proposal, 25-16, with four abstentions, according to a Taiwan foreign ministry statement, adding that the ministry is watching developments closely.It said the vote was held after seven Paraguayan senators associated with the left-leaning party caucus ""Frente Guazú"" petitioned on March 30 to establish formal ties with Beijing in exchange for medical supplies from China amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and direct access to China's market.Speaking during a Legislative session Monday, Wu said the opposition party in Paraguay has always been ""unfriendly"" toward Taiwan but the government maintains cordial ties with the Paraguayan ruling administration and thus has confidence in bilateral ties.The vote came not long after Taiwan's former ambassador to the South American country, Diego Chou (周麟), recently concluded his tenure and returned to Taiwan.Some had questioned the timing of Chou's homecoming less than two years since assuming the position, when Taiwanese ambassadors usually serve at least three years in their posts, wondering if the decision hinted at a diplomatic rift between the two allies.Asked to comment, Wu said that Chou was transferred home as part of a ""regular"" personnel reshuffle. He did not elaborate.The Paraguayan government has already accepted Taiwan's proposed candidate for Chou's successor and that person will assume the post in a day or two, Wu added.Paraguay has had diplomatic relations with Taiwan since 1957 and is its only ally in South America among its 15 worldwide.Since President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) took office in May 2016, Taiwan has lost seven diplomatic allies, three of which are in the Central American and Caribbean region -- Panama, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic.During a visit to Taiwan in October 2018, Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez pledged that the friendship between his country and the Republic of China (Taiwan) will never change and that Paraguay will forever remain Taiwan's loyal ally in South America.(By Matt Yu and Joseph Yeh) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005110013
05/11/2020,"Taipei, May 11 (CNA) Taiwan has been ranked as the third-best destination for investment in the latest U.S. Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) report, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday.In a statement, the MOEA said Taiwan received a total score of 61 for profit opportunity recommendation (POR) -- the overall indicator used by BERI to evaluate each country as an investment destination.Though the score was two points lower than Taiwan received in the December 2019 report, it was still the third highest among the 50 countries assessed, up one notch from the previous rankings.The only two countries ahead of Taiwan in the latest BERI rankings were Switzerland (total POR score 71) and Norway (62).According to BERI, the business risk service report provides qualitative analyses and forecasts for 50 countries three times per year -- April, August and December, but there was no explanation why this year's first report was released behind schedule, the MOEA said.BERI uses three main indicators to assess investment conditions -- operating conditions (operation risk), political risk, and foreign exchange/external accounts position (remittance and repatriation factor) risk.The MOEA said Taiwan benefited from an improvement in the political risk factor, which scored 46, up from 42 in December.The improvement, which moved Taiwan up to 13th in the political risk category from 27th in the previous evaluation, came after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party retained the presidency and its majority in the Legislature in January's elections.Meanwhile, Taiwan scored 60 in the operating risk factor, down from 64 in December but still ranking as the third best score in the world, and it had the highest score (77) for the remittance and repatriation factor, retaining its top spot from the previous report.In Asia, Singapore tied South Korea in fifth place for overall POR, followed by Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia, which ranked 11th, 14th and 18th respectively.India and Vietnam tied for 20th, and China ranked 23rd.(By Wu Po-wei and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005110020
05/11/2020,"Taipei, May 11 (CNA) Several communities in Taiwan are grappling with the dilemma of whether they want mobile base stations and their potential health risks in their areas, with two of them set to debate the issue Tuesday.Ganjing Ward in Changhua County's Hemei Township will hold a meeting for local residents after base stations used by three major mobile service providers -- Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan Mobile and Far EasTone -- were shut down, affecting 1,000 of the wards' 1,200 families.Ward chief Chen Ming-huan (陳明桓) on Saturday said the signals of the base stations were cut because a resident protested their location, leading the owner of the site to contact the telecom companies to move them away.According to Chen, residents will be presented with two options at Tuesday's meeting -- move the base stations out of the ward and leave residents without any mobile phone access, or find a new location for the operators, whose rent will be used as a community development fund.An elderly resident, also surnamed Chen, told CNA he was more concerned about health issues than having mobile services.In Chiayi County, meanwhile, National Chiayi University will discuss the construction of base stations at the university, which broke ground in April, with its Minsyong campus neighbor, National Minsyong Vocational High School of Agriculture and Technology.Though the base stations are being built only 50 meters away from the high school, the university has not discussed the project with the school or local residents, the high school's principal, Chung Shun-shui (鍾順水), told CNA Sunday.The project has led to concerns over the health of the school's teachers and students, and the school sent a letter to the National Communications Commission (NCC), asking it not to issue a permit for the use of the base stations, Chung said.The university said it had first planned to discuss the issue with the high school as early as 2005, but the discussion never took place.The base stations are finally being built because of repeated complaints from university students over their poor mobile phone reception, and the project's location was evaluated by Chunghwa Telecom and approved by the NCC.It's a different story in the southern county of Pingtung, where residents of an indigenous tribe are looking forward to the completion of base stations in October, Checheng Township chief Chang Chun-kuei (張春桂) said Monday.Chang said the project was one of her campaign promises when she ran for office five years ago, and the three major telecom companies finally began building the facilities at a cost of over NT$8 million (US$267,285) in April.Residents of the village, currently the only one in the township without mobile phone signals, hope the new facilities can improve communications during the upcoming typhoon season and help the development of local tourism, Chang said.(By Wu Jhe-hao, Huang Kuo-fang, Kuo Chu-chen and Kay Liu) ednitem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005110019

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — On Monday (May 12) it was reported that China’s People's Liberation Army (PLA) is planning to conduct a large-scale landing exercise in August in the South China Sea with the aim of one day capturing the Taiwan-controlled Dongsha islands (Pratas Islands, 東沙群島).

The beach landing exercise will be carried out by the Southern Theater Command and will involve large numbers of marines, landing ships, hovercrafts, and helicopters: maneuvers on an unprecedented scale, according to Kyodo News.

The Chinese military has grown increasingly anxious about the numerous U.S. military aerial and naval operations in the South China Sea, which has become a potential flashpoint for conflict. U.S. electronic warfare and reconnaissance aircraft frequently fly in the airspace near the Dongsha islands, with more than 13 missions flown in the disputed waters in April alone.

Furthermore, the Trump administration has strengthened relations with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), which China sees as an unlawful partnership. The planned August drills will only increase tensions with the U.S. and Taiwan, the article stated.

The Chinese Navy already has a base on Hainan island, where its domestic aircraft carrier “Shandong,” is stationed. However, given recurrent American military maneuvers in the region and enhanced U.S.-Taiwan relations, the PLA’s need to control the Dongsha islands has increased.

The Dongsha islands, consisting of one island, two coral reefs, and two banks, is located about 444 km from Kaohsiung. At 353,668 acres, it is a designated national park, featuring vibrant corals and a seagrass bed ecosystem.

The Taiwanese territory would be a strategically advantageous addition for the Chinese military to seize, as it would allow direct access to the Pacific Ocean. According to Kyodo News, China is currently expanding its South China Sea military bases in the Spratly Islands (南沙群島) and Paracel Islands (西沙群島).

In response to China's planned military exercises, Major General Lin Wen-huang (林文皇), Ministry of Defense (MND) Chief of Joint Operations, stated that the ministry had preparations and plans in place in the case of a Chinese attack. He assured the public that the MND is always on guard when it comes to the nation's defense, including the Dongsha islands.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3932533

Early Tuesday morning, Wong posted a photo of a colorful calligraphy work on Facebook and wrote that he had arrived in Taiwan and will begin 14 days of quarantine. In the comments below a Taiwanese fan welcomed him to immigrate to Taiwan, to which he cryptically responded: ""I'm in the midst of preparing.""

During the daily afternoon Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) briefing, CECC spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) said that Wong came on a business entry permit to act in films. Due to a flood of coronavirus cases coming in from abroad, Taiwan on March 19 banned all foreign arrivals, with the exception of persons holding an Alien Resident Certificate (ARC, 居留證), diplomatic officials, and businesspeople with special entry permits.

Chuang said that Wong's application for a permit to work as an actor was in line with current requirements and was examined and approved by the relevant authorities. As to when the entry ban will be eased on travelers from Hong Kong, Health Minister and CECC head Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said that the whole epidemic situation will be assessed.

He said that it appears that Hong Kong has the outbreak under control and Macau is handling it very well now. However, he cautioned that it is still too early to open the borders and it should be carried out in stages.

Chen said that important economic and trade links should be tried first, before gradually opening up other areas. Chen emphasized that the center is not yet currently considering opening up Taiwan to foreign tourists.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3932603

05/12/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s success in using technology as part of its response to the Wuhan coronavirus has received international attention and created new opportunities for future cooperation with other countries.

The Ministry of Science and Technology announced Monday (5/11) in a press release that the Taiwan-India Overseas Research Center has been able to promote cooperation between officials and academics by implementing a campus epidemic prevention framework based on the “smart epidemic prevention system” developed by Chung Cheng University, CNA reported.



The ministry has launched several new southward initiatives to set up centers focusing on scientific and technological research in target countries. Since 2017, 12 overseas research centers have been established in nine South and Southeast Asian countries, according to CNA.

After receiving a grant in 2018, Chung Cheng University in cooperation with the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar set up the “Taiwan-Indian Artificial Intelligence Technology Innovation Research Center.”



The smart epidemic prevention system has three main components, including automatic temperature sensing, facial recognition, and contact tracing history. The system was designed using AI technology developed jointly by professors and students in Taiwan and India, according to the ministry’s press release.



Not only does the automatic temperature sensing use the latest thermal imaging cameras, it also has temperature measurement software that helps optimize accuracy. In terms of helping with social distancing, the smart system cuts down on the number of people needed to take temperatures around campus, the press release said.

The facial recognition feature has an accuracy rate of over 90 percent and can perform neural network optimization for Asian faces. In addition, professors and students from Chung Cheng University were able to improve the software processing method in order to overcome slow performance with large numbers of people. Because the system uses Edge AI technology, the database is not online, which helps with privacy concerns.

According to the press release, data from the temperature sensors and facial recognition are then used to analyze contact tracing. One advantage of this system is that regional personnel without phones can also be tracked under the smart system.



The Ministry of Science and Technology said the smart epidemic prevention system has established a good opportunity for cooperation between Taiwan and India, and it hopes that future bilateral cooperation can be extended to other areas as well.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3932492

05/13/2020,"President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) has vowed to strengthen Taiwan's psychiatric care services while offering her condolences to the widow of a Taichung dentist murdered by a man with a history of mental health issues.

Tsai made the pledge on Tuesday in a letter to the dentist's widow, Tsou Feng-chu (鄒鳳珠), in response to Tsou's appeal for help last week after the Taichung branch of the Taiwan High Court upheld a lower court's decision to give Lai Ya-sheng (賴亞生) a life sentence for the murder.

Lai fatally stabbed Tsou's husband, surnamed Wang (王), and injured two dental assistants as he tried to kill his estranged sister at the clinic where she worked on May 24, 2017.

In an April 29 decision, the Taichung court ruled that Lai's history of schizophrenia constituted grounds for a reduced sentence under Article 19 of Taiwan's Criminal Code and therefore declined to impose the death penalty.

Tsou, who noted that a life sentence would leave Lai eligible for parole after only 25 years, called the ruling ""unacceptable.""

She asked prosecutors to appeal the verdict to the Supreme Court and ask it to give Lai the death penalty.

On May 8, she protested the decision at the Presidential Office Building, where she delivered a bouquet of flowers and a card addressed to Tsai.

In the card, she urged the president to ensure that her husband's death does not go in vain, and to work quickly to repair Taiwan's ""broken"" society.

On Tuesday, Tsou said she received a handwritten response from Tsai, in which the president thanked her for her comments and told her the government is currently studying ways to strengthen Taiwan's handling of a range of issues related to mental health.

""The areas we are looking at are largely in line with your suggestions. I hope you are able to overcome the pain of losing Dr. Wang, and to work with us to strengthen psychiatric services, improve our judiciary procedures and laws in this area, and better protect the general public,"" Tsai wrote.

In response, Tsou said she hoped the government would conduct a comprehensive review of the way it cares for people suffering from schizophrenia, and consider such measures as indefinite detentions for psychiatric patients who pose a threat to the community.

By Shelley Shan / Staff reporter





Tropical Storm Vongfong is unlikely to make landfall in the nation, but could bring heavy rain if it interacts with a stationary front, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said yesterday.

The storm formed at about 8pm on Tuesday. Its center was 1,400km southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻) as of 2pm yesterday, moving northwest at 14kph, bureau data showed.

Although the storm’s radius remained 80km, the bureau said that it could develop into a typhoon, which would expand its radius.

Vongfong is forecast to move west and make landfall in the Philippines today, bureau forecaster Liu Yu-chi (劉宇其) said.

It would turn north afterward and enter the Bashi Channel by early Sunday morning, he said, adding that it would then accelerate and move northeast away from Taiwan.

“The storm would come closest to the nation on Sunday, which would bring showers to the nation’s east coast. If the storm’s path moves further west, chances of showers in southern Taiwan would be high as well,” Liu said.

The storm’s intensity and movement would be subject to change before it moves closer to the nation’s southeast coast, he said.

“The storm is expected to weaken after making landfall in the Philippines and the degree to which it would weaken would determine how it would affect Taiwan,” he added.

Meteorologists abroad disagreed on how Vongfong would affect the weather in Taiwan, Liu said.

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts projected that Vongfong would make a wide turn west before moving north.

However, it might be downgraded from a typhoon by the time it comes closer to Taiwan, the organization said.

The US Joint Typhoon Warning Center has forecast that Vongfong would only make a small turn before moving northeast away from the Philippines.

It would maintain the intensity of a tropical storm or a typhoon as it moves north, but it would move farther away from Taiwan, the center said.

Asked whether Vongfong’s move north would trigger the southwest jet stream and whether the jet stream would interact with a stationary front that is to affect Taiwan next week, bringing heavy rainfall to the nation, Liu said that Vongfong would pick up speed and move northeast soon after it enters the Bashi Channel on Sunday, but the stationary front would not affect the nation until Tuesday next week.

How and whether the two weather systems would interact depends on the storm’s intensity and path, he said.

A southwest wind would be blowing in the South China Sea next week, which would bring warm and wet air to Taiwan, Liu said.

If it combines with a stationary front, humidity would rise in the nation, making the weather unstable nationwide, he said, urging people to closely monitor weather reports.

Former bureau Weather Forecast Center director Daniel Wu (吳德榮) said that the unstable weather would begin on Monday next week, when the southwest wind and humidity are to rise, causing showers and thundershowers nationwide.

Starting on Tuesday, the nation would come under the influence of the second stationary front of the plum rain season, Wu said, adding that the front would move slowly and linger around the nation.

The combination of a stationary front and the southwest jet stream could bring heavy rainfall to the nation, he said, adding that this could affect the nation more than Vongfong.

The public should closely monitor weather updates, he said.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/05/14/2003736382

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwanese Coast Guard announced Wednesday (May 12) that the Dongsha Islands Garrison is scheduled to conduct an annual firing exercise around the islands in June.

The drills, which will be supervised by Ministry of National Defense (MND) officials, are meant to maintain the shooting effectiveness of various mortar and machine-gun positions on the islands.

The Dongsha islands, which consist of one island, two coral reefs, and two banks, are located about 444 km from Kaohsiung. The designated national park spans 353,668 acres and features vibrant coral and a seagrass bed ecosystem.

Reports on Monday stated that China’s People's Liberation Army (PLA) plans to hold a large-scale landing exercise in the South China Sea in August to simulate an invasion of the Taiwan-controlled Dongsha islands (Pratas islands, 東沙群島). Kyodo News reported that the PLA's landing exercise would be supervised by the Southern Theater Command and involve large numbers of landing ships, hovercraft, helicopters, and marines.

Two squadrons of the Coast Guard’s Dongsha Command are stationed on both sides of the islands, according to UDN. In addition, 20 and 40-mm guns, 81 and 120-mm mortars, and other light infantry equipment are distributed all over the islands, and military installations have been renovated in recent years.

MND spokesman Shih Shun-wen(史順文), said that the nation’s military employs joint intelligence, surveillance tactics, and reconnaissance missions to track the PLA’s every move in surrounding areas. The ministry has provided assistance for “Project Border Protection” (衛疆計畫) on Dongsha and Taiping (Itu Aba, 太平島) islands, UDN reported.

Meanwhile, the Mainland Affairs Council called on the Chinese Communist Party not to misjudge the situation so as to avoid unnecessarily increasing cross-strait tensions.

05/13/2020,"Taipei, May 13 (CNA) About 20 environmental protection groups on Wednesday delivered a petition to the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association, expressing opposition to the discharge of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean.Roughly 1.2 million metric tons of contaminated water remains from the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that hit the plant on March 11, 2011, destroying key cooling functions and causing a huge leakage of radiation.The wastewater contains approximately 880 trillion becquerels of tritium, a hydrogen isotope that experts say poses a relatively low risk to human health.The Japanese government is currently soliciting public opinion on wastewater treatment until June 15, after which it will decide what to do with the contaminated water. One of the options is dumping it into the ocean.""We learned Japan is considering discharging wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi plant into the ocean. The plan will cause radioactive contamination to marine ecology. We were astonished to learn this and resolutely oppose it,"" the Taiwanese groups said in their petition.The groups said they were not there to protest but to appeal to the Japanese government to listen to neighboring countries and not to make the wrong decision.Currently, 2,000 groups and individuals around the world have signed a petition opposing discharging the wastewater into the sea, while about 20 groups in Taiwan submitted a petition to the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association, said Tsui Shu-hsin (崔愫欣), General Secretary of anti-nuclear organization Green Citizens' Action Alliance.If Japan goes ahead with such a plan, the Taiwanese groups do not rule out holding protests, Tsui said.Releasing the wastewater into the sea is not the only option, Tsui said, adding that it could also be put into larger storage tanks by consolidating the sludge or soil particles, though that would be more expensive.Although discharging the wastewater into the ocean is the cheapest approach, ""We resolutely oppose using this treatment method,"" Tsui said.Despite the fact that plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co., (TEPCO) has installed filtration systems to remove radioactive isotopes strontium-90 and caesium-137, it cannot remove tritium residue in the wastewater, while 70 percent of the water still contains the radioactive elements strontium-90 and caesium-137.As such, dumping the wastewater into the ocean, could cause enormous damage to the marine environment, said Tsai Ya-ying (蔡雅瀅), a lawyer affiliated with the Wild at Heart Legal Defense Association.Japan, a signatory country of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, should adopt all necessary measures to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment in accordance with Article 194 of the convention. It also needs to ensure other countries do not suffer from the effects of environmental damage caused by contamination, Tsai noted.She called on Japan to reject the possibility of dumping radioactive wastewater into the sea to avoid adversely impacting neighboring countries and hurting good relations between Taiwan and Japan.(By Yeh Su-ping and Evelyn Kao) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005130011

05/14/2020,"Taipei, May 14 (CNA) A stricter set of quarantine measures for returning far-sea fishermen will go into effect on May 18, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said Thursday.The new measures, which were announced on May 1, require workers on far-sea fishing boats to undergo a 14-day period of mandatory quarantine on returning to Taiwan, either in individual rooms on their vessels or at a quarantine hotel, according to the CECC.Only workers on ships that for the duration of their journey do not dock at any ports, undergo no crew changes, are not inspected at sea, or do not transfer their cargo to other ships, are exempted from this requirement.A previous version of the regulation rolled out in April only required ships to meet the above conditions for the month prior to their return.However, many employers have pointed out that far-sea fishing vessels are often at sea for over six months, and rely on other ships to provide necessities and help bring their catch to port, which means quarantine is all but certain.As most of these workers are migrants and there is a lack of space on fishing vessels to quarantine the crew safely, employers will have to pay for their stay at quarantine hotels.This could end up costing employers up to NT$1 million (US$33,150) if they have a 50-man crew, said Taiwan Squid Fishery Association President Lei Tzu-kang (雷祖綱).A total of 77 squid fishing boats carrying around 4,000 workers are due to return to Taiwan in June and July, Lei added.Another concern that employers have is the number of rooms available at quarantine hotels.According to Ho Shih-chieh (何世杰), secretary-general of the Taiwan Tuna Longline Association, most squid fishing boats dock at Qianzhen Fish Port in the southern city of Kaohsiung, a city that has only 900 rooms available at quarantine hotels.Pingtung County, where most tuna fishing boats dock, only has 200 such rooms available, Ho said.After a meeting with the Fisheries Agency on Thursday, CECC Deputy Commander Chen Tsung-yen (陳宗彥) said that Kaohsiung City government will have to help local hotels increase capacity to 2,000 rooms.If that fails to meet demand, workers will be able to stay at centralized quarantine centers, Chen said.Pingtung County and eastern Yilan County, where some far-sea fishing boats dock, will also have to boost the capacity at quarantine hotels, Chen said.As for employers' concerns about expense, Fisheries Agency Deputy Director-General Wang Cheng-fang (王正芳) said they will continue to discuss the issue of subsidies.(By Yang Su-min, Chang Ming-hsuan, and Chiang Yi-ching) Enditem/AW",https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202005140017

Fu Kun-chi (傅崐萁), 58, is a legislator and former county magistrate for Hualien who exerts considerable influence in the sparsely populated east coast region. He served as legislator for the area from 2002 until 2009, then ruled as county chief for the maximum two consecutive terms from 2010 to 2018, when his wife, Kuomintang (KMT) member Hsu Chen-wei (徐榛蔚), succeeded him.

After he spent seven months in prison last year for insider trading, he won a seat in the Legislative Yuan in the January elections. Even though a renewed stint in jail might be expected to cause the loss of his position and his salary and a by-election for his legislative seat within three months, his latest sentence for stock manipulation in a 1997 scandal did not include the removal of his political rights.

The Taiwan High Court sentenced Fu to two years and seven months last year, but following an appeal, the Supreme Court did not confirm the original prison sentence until Thursday, CNA reported.

While it was not immediately known when Fu would enter jail, the authorities were already taking precautions to prevent him from fleeing the country.

05/15/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — In response to Japanese media reports that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is planning on holding war games in August to prepare for a future assault on the Taiwan-controlled Dongsha Islands (Pratas Islands, 東沙群島), China on Wednesday (May 13) threatened that it could turn the military exercises into an invasion of the island and even Taiwan proper itself.

On Monday (May 12), Kyodo News reported that the PLA's Southern Theater Command is allegedly planning a simulated invasion of the Dongsha islands with Hainan island as its practice field. The mock invasion will reportedly take place in August and include a large number of marines, landing ships, hovercraft, and helicopters.

In response to the report, China's state-run mouthpiece the Global Times on Wednesday cited ""experts"" as saying that the Dongsha Islands are in a ""strategically important location and that the PLA has the capability of turning ""any exercise into action if Taiwan secessionists insist on secession."" The news site neither confirmed nor denied the war games will take place, only saying that the ""Chinese side has not announced the drills.""

The outlet then repeated Kyodo News' assertion that the Dongsha Islands hold a strategic position, as it is nestled between the Baishi Channel at Taiwan's southern flank and PLA bases in Hainan to the south. It also seemed to confirm the Japanese news agency's speculation that the exercises could be a prelude to China establishing an air defense identification zone in the South China Sea.

The Chinese tabloid then cited ""military expert"" Song Zhongping as saying that the Dongsha Islands are in a key location off the southeastern coast of China that links the South China Sea and West Pacific. Seeming to allude to a potential pretext for invasion, Song warned that if Taiwan leased the island to the U.S. military for surveillance or anti-submarine activities, ""this could be dangerous to the PLA.""

Song then blamed flaring cross-strait tensions on ""increasing secession activities"" by the Tsai administration. He claimed that given this ""condition,"" the PLA will need to prepare for a military confrontation, including holding military exercises, to ""warn Taiwan secessionists not to cross the red line.""

Song then ominously stated that the landing drills were preparations for seizing Taiwan's outer islands as well as its main island. He warned that the games could be quickly converted into an actual invasion in response to unspecified activities by ""secessionists"":

""Landing missions have been regular training subjects of the PLA. Island takeover trainings like these are literally aimed at islands, like the Dongsha Islands, Penghu Islands and the larger island, namely Taiwan Island. If Taiwan secessionists insist on secession, military exercises can turn into action any time.""",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3934713

As the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues, Taiwan’s case to attend the May 18-19 WHA video conference as an observer has been gaining support beyond its core allies. In a letter to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, China claims Taiwan’s status is a “controversial” issue and should therefore not be considered, according to Foreign Policy.

The message said Beijing was ready to cooperate with Tedros to “prevent the Assembly from being disrupted.” Tedros has repeatedly come under fire for caving in to Beijing’s demands, including changing the name of the virus to COVID-19 to remove any references to China, and delaying the labeling of the outbreak as a pandemic.

05/16/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's Presidential Office has allegedly been hacked and minutes from meetings were sent to reporters, including discussions about how to deter President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) rival William Lai (賴清德) in the 2019 party primary.

Reporters received emails suggesting misconduct by Tsai. The National Security Council is investigating how the internal emails were leaked and why they were doctored to hurt Tsai's reputation, integrity, and legitimacy.

The most contentious leaked documents, which may or may not be authentic, appear to be conversations between Tsai and Lai. During the discussions, Tsai disagreed with Lai's participation in the DPP party primary to compete for the 2020 presidential nomination, and she reportedly took part in schemes to undermine Lai, media reported.

The other leaked documents include conversations and plans about the recent Cabinet reshuffle, which is expected to be completed ahead of the presidential inauguration on Wednesday (May 20). The emails appear to show Tsai favors certain candidates in her camp and hints at a possible power play between herself and Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌), who will retain his post during Tsai’s second term.

The Taiwanese-American Nobel laureate Dr. Yuan Tseh Lee (李遠哲), who publicly opposed Tsai's reelection run in early 2019, was mentioned in one leaked document. The leak appears to show he was not favored by Tsai's inner circle to remain in post as an advisor to the government.

05/16/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜), facing a recall vote early next month, is calling on his supporters not to turn out to polling stations.

The Kuomintang (KMT) mayor has previously refrained from making any direct comments on the months-long campaign to unseat him. Nevertheless, he has attempted to take legal action to halt the recall vote after the Central Election Commission approved it in mid-April.

In a video clip that was published via his Facebook on Friday evening (May 15), Han responded to the recall action for the first time, urging his supporters not to take part in the vote scheduled for June 6. The 62-year-old mayor instead asked those who support him to monitor the vote-counting process after the polls close at 4 p.m.

Han also asked non-Kaohsiung residents who are supporters not to visit the city on election day, for fear it could create “more space for imagination.” “Care for Han Kuo-yu but don’t put it into action,” said the mayor, dressed in a white shirt, appearing calm and relaxed.

Han said he “personally respects fully” the public’s right to vote and to recall, but he argued that Kaohsiung residents should appreciate how hard his city government team has worked over the past 18 months. In concluding his brief talk, the mayor said he is confident of Kaohsiung's future development.

The recall motion began taking shape last summer after Han announced his bid for the presidency, breaking a promise he made during his mayoral campaign in 2018. Even though the mayor has largely kept a low profile following a bruising loss to President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) in January’s presidential election, the movement initiated by civil groups and the pro-independence Taiwan Statebuilding Party to recall Han has not ebbed with time.

If the recall vote succeeds, Han will be the first municipal leader in the history of Taiwan elections to be ousted directly by the electorate. It is, however, not easy, as at least 570,000 Kaohsiung residents, or one-quarter of the city’s 2.28 million eligible voters, have to vote in favor of recalling Han to succeed.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3935203

STAYING AHEAD: TSMC’s planned 5 nanometer US plant would not start producing chips until 2024, when its Taiwan-based plant would be making 2 nanometer chips

Staff writer, with CNA and Bloomberg





Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s (TSMC, 台積電) plan to build an advanced wafer foundry in Arizona would not undercut its technological edge in Taiwan, economists said.

“When the planned Arizona plant using the 5 nanometer process starts production in 2024, TSMC will have advanced to the 2 nanometer process [in Taiwan],” Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER, 台灣經濟研究院) research fellow Arisa Liu (劉佩真) said.

“Even if the US has the plant run by TSMC, Taiwan is expected to remain competitive as the Taiwanese semiconductor sector will own advanced technologies,” Liu said.

On Friday, TSMC announced plans to invest US$12 billion to build the 5 nanometer fab, saying that construction is scheduled to start next year.

The 5 nanometer process is currently the world’s most advanced mass production process, but the company is developing a more sophisticated 3 nanometer process that could start mass production in 2022.

Liu said that TSMC’s 5 nanometer plant in Taiwan is expected to produce 80,000 wafers a month by the end of this year, four times the capacity of the planned US facility, and that is likely to grow next year.

At the same time, the investment in Arizona falls short of TSMC’s annual capital expenditure of between US$15 billion and US$16 billion, Liu added.

“So whether you look at [capital expenditure] or output,” TSMC and, by extension, Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, should maintain its lead, Liu said.

Stephen Su (蘇孟宗), head of the government-sponsored Industrial Technology Research Institute’s (工研院) Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center, said that TSMC chose Arizona as it is home to several semiconductor plants, including Intel Corp and NXP Semiconductors NV.

This would provide TSMC an existing supply chain to work with, Su said.

The state also has the advantages of dry weather and few natural disasters, such as earthquakes, Su said, adding that the higher labor costs in the US are not expected to be a problem because foundries are highly automated through cloud-based technologies.

Liu said that the proposed investment was likely a necessary move, because US-based businesses account for about 60 percent of its sales, and rising trade tensions between the US and China could force producers to move some production to the US.

Separately, Chinese state-backed funds pumped US$2.25 billion into a Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC, 中芯國際) wafer plant to support advanced chip manufacturing, as Washington tightens technology restrictions on China.

The SMIC plant’s registered capital jumped from US$3.5 billion to US$6.5 billion after the investment, the company said in an announcement on Friday.

The chipmaker’s stake in the Shanghai facility would fall from 50.1 percent to 38.5 percent, it said.

The plant has capacity to produce 6,000 14 nanometer wafers a month and plans to increase that to 35,000.

The investment came as Washington moved to prevent sales to Huawei Technologies Co (華為) from chipmakers using US technology.

The US Department of Commerce on Friday said it would require licenses before allowing US technology to be used by the Chinese company or its 114 subsidiaries, including its chip-design unit HiSilicon Technologies Co (海思半導體).

SMIC is planning a Shanghai share sale that could raise more than US$3 billion, based on its closing value of more than US$13 billion on Friday.

Taiwan's Presidential Office was allegedly hacked, and minutes from meetings — of unclear authenticity — were sent to reporters, including discussions about how to deter President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) former rival William Lai (賴清德) in the 2019 DPP primary and mention of a possible power struggle between Tsai and Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌).

Enoch Wu (吳怡農), a former Goldman Sachs managing director who worked on Taiwan's NSC from 2017 to 2019, expressed his view Sunday (May 17) on the alleged hacking of the Presidential Office. He said that having served as an advisor to the NSC, he is aware of ""a lot"" of data breaches at Taiwanese government agencies over the past few years that have not been made known to the public.

""Despite endless government insistence that 'information security is national security,' the attacks have never been effectively subdued and nearly all core government units have been infiltrated,"" said Wu, adding that ""the damage is difficult to assess because government agency networks are connected.""

""Every time a data breach occurs, each agency seeks external help to 'clean up' office desktops and network servers and that's the end, while it needs to be addressed properly to avoid the attacks from happening again and again.""

He attributed the frequent breaches to three phenomena: role or function ambiguity in the field of cybersecurity, which ends up with no one really in charge; reliance on third parties to maintain security networks; and poor security awareness and practices between government officials, which altogether create loopholes for hackers.

Wu suggested that the president create a post for a chief cybersecurity officer who would be responsible for protecting information networks and have the authority to coordinate working parties in effectively addressing challenges. Furthermore, he recommends that the central government develop a cloud-based, centralized and secured solution for local governments to endure systematic attacks as well as keep security networks up to date — with all the work being done in-house.

Lastly, according to Wu, many high-level officials store sensitive documents on personal devices and rely on LINE, Telegram, and Signal to communicate with each other.

A doyen of Taiwan’s “nativist literature movement,” Chung Chao-cheng (鍾肇政) passed away at his home in Taoyuan on Saturday, his family said. He was 95.

Chung’s son Chung Yen-wei (鍾延威) said the family discovered Chung not breathing at about 7pm.

Despite his father’s age, he was in relatively stable health over the past few years, Chung Yen-wei said.

The family said it is deeply saddened and shocked by his sudden passing, and is preparing for his funeral.

Born in Taoyuan’s Longtan (龍潭) in 1925 during Japanese colonial rule, Chung Chao-cheng, a Hakka, was widely considered the doyen of the literature movement. He was most famous for his works The Dull Ice Flower (魯冰花), the Turbid Waters Trilogy (濁流三部曲) and the Taiwanese Trilogy (台灣人三部曲).

Director Yang Li-kuo (楊立國) adapted The Dull Ice Flower into a film, released in 1989, that was nominated for six Golden Horse Awards and won two, Best Supporting Actress and Best Original Song.

Chung Chao-cheng’s classics of Taiwanese literature depict the lives and fates of Taiwanese against the background of post-World War II Taiwan, following the end of the Japanese colonial period.

He wrote more than 30 novels and 150 short stories, as well as scores of essays, even though he taught at the Longtan Elementary School until 1979.

In mourning his passing, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) expressed her condolences to his family and said his death was a great loss to the nation’s literary circle.

In a Facebook post, Tsai also praised Chung Chao-cheng for playing an important role in promoting Hakka culture and Taiwanese literature.

Chung Chao-cheng and other writers of his time had jointly published a regular newsletter during the post-war era called the Literary Bulletin, which proved essential to young and aspiring writers of the time, Tsai said.

Tsai said she would always remember him as an elder who saw her as his own child.

She pledged to bear his teachings in mind to continue the promotion of Hakka and Taiwanese culture so that his legacy would last for generations to come.

Writer Chen Fang-ming (陳芳明) said Chung Chao-cheng had a tremendous impact on the development of Taiwanese literature.

Chung Chao-cheng played a crucial rule during the transitional period in the 1950s after the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) took over the governing of Taiwan from Japan, Chen said.

Reuters, TAIPEI





Taiwan is complying with international sanctions against North Korea, a senior security official told the US’ deputy representative for North Korea yesterday, having previously been called out for breaking them.

Taiwan is not a member of the UN, but says that as a responsible global player it is committed to ensuring sanctions are enforced to rein in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.

In 2018, independent UN monitors told a UN Security Council sanctions committee in a confidential report that they had investigated cases of ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products in contravention of sanctions and that the network behind the vessels was primarily based in Taiwan.

Two Taiwanese men and two local companies were named in a sanction list released by the US Department of the Treasury on Aug. 31 last year for participating in ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products destined for North Korea.

National Security Council Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Ming-yen (蔡明彥) headed a team that took part in a telephone meeting yesterday with US Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Deputy Assistant Secretary for North Korea Alex Wong (黃之瀚) to discuss the situation on the Korean Peninsula, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a news release.

Tsai and Wong exchanged opinions about how both sides could work together to push North Korea to achieve verifiable denuclearization and promote regional security, it said.

As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan would continue to work closely with the US and carry out international sanctions on North Korea, it said.

Officials from the Executive Yuan’s Department of Cyber Security and Anti-Money Laundering Office, and the Coast Guard Administration took part in the telephone meeting, it said.

Taiwan has called on local companies to comply with UN sanctions, and in 2017 it suspended refined oil and liquefied natural gas exports to North Korea, as well as clothing and textile imports, to comply with UN resolutions.

Data compiled by the MOEA showed that the country's export orders totaled US$38.53 billion, up 2.3 percent from a year earlier, after a year-on-year increase of 4.3 percent in March.

On a month-on-month basis, the April figure was down 4.3 percent, and after seasonal adjustments, it was also down 0.3 percent, the data indicated.

In the first four months of this year, Taiwan's export orders fell 2.0 percent from a year earlier to US$142.77 billion, the MOEA said.

In April, on the back of solid demand for 5G communication applications and high-performance computing devices, electronic component makers, which include semiconductor suppliers, printed circuit board producers and passive component makers, received US$11.29 billion in export orders, up 16.2 percent from a year earlier, the MOEA said.

The ministry said that massive lockdowns in many countries to battle COVID-19 boosted demand for remote work and online learning, so makers of information and communication devices such as notebook computers and servers enjoyed an 18.6 percent year-on-year increase in export orders in April totaling US$12.49 billion.

However, the old economy sector continued to feel the pinch from the fall in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, seeing their export orders falling at a double-digit pace in April, the MOEA said.

In April, export orders placed to base metal and machinery makers in the country fell 20.8 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively, from a year earlier to US$1.73 billion and US$1.53 billion, the statistics showed.

According to the data, export orders received by Taiwanese plastic/rubber producers and chemical item suppliers totaled US$1.52 billion and US$1.33 billion, respectively in April, down 23.3 percent and 22.7 percent, from a year earlier.

In April, the United States placed the largest orders to Taiwanese exporters at US$10.95 billion, up 6.8 percent from a year earlier, followed by China/Hong Kong (US$10.39 billion, up 9.2 percent) and Europe (US$8.25 billion, up 7.6 percent).

The MOEA said that how Taiwan's export orders will perform in the future will depend on the COVID-19 development, and forecast that the figure for May will range between US$38 billion and US$39.5 billion. (By Wu Po-wei and Frances Huang)",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3937573

05/20/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Thursday (May 21) announced one new imported case of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the first in two weeks.

During his daily press conference on Thursday afternoon, Minister of Health and Welfare and CECC head Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) announced that there was one new imported case of coronavirus, raising the total number of cases in Taiwan to 441. No. 441 is a Taiwanese man in his 30s who flew to Mexico for work in late January and returned to the country on Wednesday (May 20).

Chen said that during the man's stay in Mexico, he developed a fever April 30 to May 1 and a slight cough on May 5. From May 11 to May 13, the man started to suffer from diarrhea.

When the man arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday, he took the initiative to inform quarantine personnel that he was experiencing symptoms of coronavirus. Quarantine officers then administered a test for the disease before sending him to a quarantine center for isolation.

The man tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday and is currently undergoing treatment in a hospital isolation ward. Chen emphasized that the man wore a mask throughout his flight — and while at the airport — and did not come in contact with any friends or relatives before being placed in isolation.

The CECC announced that they had received 226 reports of people with suspected symptoms on Wednesday (May 20). Since the outbreak began, Taiwan has carried out 70,100 COVID-19 tests, with 69,077 coming back negative.

Taiwan has now extended its streak of no new local infections to 39 days, but the latest imported case ended its record of 13 consecutive days without one coming from abroad. Out of 441 total confirmed cases, 350 were imported, 55 were local, and 36 came from the Navy's ""Goodwill Fleet.""

05/20/2020,"Taiwan, Sweden showing the world

By Edward Pingyuan Lu 呂秉原





An article on the Nature magazine Web site reports that 22 scientists last month wrote to the daily Dagens Nyheter criticizing Sweden’s no-lockdown response to COVID-19. However, evidence-based analysis shows that a lockdown is not a one-size-fits-all strategy and Sweden is showing the world a sustainable way for everybody to fearlessly live with the virus, which is an inevitable situation that everyone must face and accept for a while.

The biggest myth about lockdowns is that they are the only solution when an epidemic worsens. A lockdown is a measure to cordon off a seriously affected area so that people in surrounding areas are protected.

When SARS hit Taiwan in 2003, local health authorities locked down a hospital with a nosocomial infection to protect the community.

When Wuhan became the epicenter of China’s COVID-19 outbreak in January, authorities issued a lockdown order to prevent the virus from spreading to other cities and provinces.

Italy misunderstood the lockdown measure. Italy was the first country in Europe to enforce a lockdown, starting in the north and then spreading nationwide, but on March 19, it also became the first country to have a death toll that surpassed China’s.

The lockdown measure was also misunderstood in New York state. While California and Washington, on the West Coast, were piling up confirmed cases in February, New Yorkers seemed to think that they had nothing to do with the virus.

The Wall Street Journal reported that New York hospitals did not coordinate their coronavirus response until the death toll topped 1,200. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on March 20 issued a “stay home” order and enforced strict measures, but New York became the US state with the greatest number of confirmed cases.

Belgium rushed into a lockdown, but forgot to take care of at-risk older people. The BBC on May 2 reported that 53 percent of Belgium’s 7,703 deaths occurred in care homes. It quoted Belgium officials as saying that because of poor preparation, care home staff lacked personal protective equipment, which allowed the virus to spread quickly.

An analysis by Israeli scientist Isaac Ben-Israel shows that the COVID-19 pandemic would run its course despite lockdowns or similar measures.

One price of chaotic restrictions — which the whole world must pay for — is the collapse of supply chains. This has led to many frontline medical personnel having to fight the coronavirus without personal protective equipment.

A “flu-like epidemic control” better describes Sweden’s response to the pandemic — COVID-19 is highly contagious and has a transmission pattern similar to a flu-like epidemic, with so many nations worldwide reporting confirmed cases. The most beneficial and sustainable measures for most nations are flu control protocols.

Germany’s first two infected people contracted COVID-19 at the end of January from a colleague who flew in from Shanghai to join a company workshop. Soon after, two other colleagues, who had not had contact with the Chinese visitor, tested positive for the coronavirus.

The cluster showed how the coronavirus is transmitted from human to human — very similar to an influenza virus — and showed that COVID-19 can present as mild flu-like symptoms.

Singapore and Japan in February offered evidence on a larger scale. As of Feb. 29, Singapore had reported 93 cases, including five clusters and quite a few patients whose source of infection could not be traced. This showed that the coronavirus could spread easily within a community, just like an influenza virus.

By February, Japan had confirmed more than 250 cases — excluding the cruise ship cases. Most of those infected only had flu-like symptoms only, while six older patients died of pneumonia. So, in Japan, the coronavirus also looked like a flu-like epidemic, with elderly people more likely to have a severe illness and to die.

The frighteningly high death tolls in China and Italy could have resulted from collapsing healthcare systems, where too many people were rushing to hospitals for treatment, a scenario seen in flu-like epidemics.

However, most people appeared too nervous to notice the “flu-like epidemic” pattern of COVID-19, as they rushed into lockdowns and criticized nations without restrictions for risking people’s lives.

Taiwan’s COVID-19 success story offers a control protocol that combines an existing surveillance system for flu-like disease symptoms, experience with SARS controls and no strict lockdowns.

The surveillance system asks clinics and hospitals to cooperate by reporting patients with flu-like symptoms for virus testing and early treatment.

While infected people and their contacts must undergo a home or facility quarantine, and healthy people are reminded to practice good hygiene at all times to flatten the epidemic curve, COVID-19 has not seriously disrupted people’s daily lives in Taiwan. For example, many people in Taipei still commute by train every day.

As of May 12, Taiwan’s population of 24 million had reported six deaths from COVID-19 and fewer than 500 confirmed cases, while New York State had 19 million residents under lockdown and more than 27,000 deaths.

In the middle of January, people in Taiwan began to wear masks, even though experts at the time could not agree on whether it helped, and the government coordinated with mask manufacturers to increase production to meet demand. By contrast, most Western countries did not add wearing masks to their control guidelines until last month.

The only thing that Sweden needs to worry about is the high number of deaths from COVID-19 in nursing homes. If nearby hospitals have spare capacity, it would be better to move care home residents to hospitals, and thoroughly clean and sanitize affected nursing homes.

Taiwan’s experience has proved that wearing a mask can be an effective extra precaution, especially for nations trying to avoid stricter measures. People do not need a surgical mask, cloth masks work well, too.

The more Swedes wear masks, the more effective Sweden’s COVID-19 control measures will appear to the world.

The photo was taken by a Kinmen resident in the island county's Guan'ao area and posted to Facebook, Liberty Times reported Wednesday (May 20). The photo was quickly reposted by another netizen to Taiwanese social media site PTT, along with an article titled “The new Xiamen airport is being built at the door of Kinmen!”

This second netizen wrote that the construction site of Xiamen Xiang'an International Airport (翔安國際機場) is only about six kilometers from Kinmen’s coastline, labeling the project as trespassing.

The post on PTT touched off a wave of heated debate, with some users lamenting that Taiwan cannot do anything about it because the construction did not extend beyond China’s border, while others were calling the construction an overreach and intrusion.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After announcing Taiwan's first new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in two weeks on Thursday (May 21), the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said it is important for Taiwanese who have contracted the virus overseas to contact health authorities before their planned return.

During the daily update on Taiwan's coronavirus cases Thursday, CECC Spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) said the new case was a Taiwanese man in his 30s who had returned to the country after traveling to Mexico for business. He added that another citizen who previously tested positive for the coronavirus in South America had also returned to Taiwan after receiving approval from the CECC.

Chuang said the individual had wanted to return home since his diagnosis and was able to do so after viral test results showed he had recovered from the disease. Chuang explained the man had tested negative twice before boarding the return flight and tested negative again upon his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.

Chuang pointed out that a Taiwanese infected with the virus in Southeast Asia had also contacted the CECC to return to Taiwan. He said the request is under review, reported UDN.

The CECC official stressed that it is mandatory for citizens who contracted the virus abroad to meet certain health criteria before being allowed in the country, adding they need to have two consecutive negative tests, or not have symptoms of the disease for two months since the onset. He added that individuals must report to the health authorities in advance and failure to do so may result in a fine of up to NT$2 million (US$66,680).

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As countries prepare to open up after coronavirus lockdowns, some Taiwanese scholars said they believe that overseas travel will not be possible until at least the summer of 2021.

After Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced it would shorten the quarantine period for business travelers from countries with a low virus risk, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) revealed it is planning to allow foreign tourists in October. However, Health Minister and CECC head Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) shot down MOTC's draft plan and said October may be too soon to resume tourism.

During a press conference on Wednesday (May 20), Chen said individuals visiting Taiwan for business and short-term stays will undergo a shortened quarantine of five to 10 days instead of the original 14 days. He stressed the shortened quarantine would only be available to visitors from ""extremely low-risk"" countries such as New Zealand and Vietnam, while those from high-risk areas will remain banned from entering Taiwan.

Former Deputy Health Minister Chang Hung-jen (張鴻仁) on Friday (May 22) voiced his support for the government's plan to gradually relax border controls, adding that he believes the island nation is free of coronavirus based on scientific evidence. He said Taiwan has not reported a single domestic case of the virus for three 14-day incubation periods, which means there is a very low risk for domestic travel.

Chang pointed out the government would encourage domestic tourism before international travel is possible. He urged Taiwanese to start planning for domestic trips and help revive the nation's economy.

05/22/2020,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After Taiwan was yet again denied entry to the World Health Assembly (WHA) earlier this week, an illustrator created this flag mocking the World Health Organization (WHO) for the inordinately strong influence communist China wields over the group.

Given that the WHO and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have been strangely in sync with their delays in acknowledging the infectiousness and seriousness of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many netizens have started to call the WHO the ""Chinese Health Organization"" or simply ""CHO.""

The term may not be such an exaggeration, as a report by Der Spiegel on May 8 revealed that Germany's intelligence agency BND found CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping (習近平) on Jan. 21 asked WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom not to announce the disease could be transmitted from human-to-human and to delay the declaration of a pandemic.

After it became clear on Monday (May 18) that Taiwan would yet again be excluded from the WHA due to Beijing's pressure on WHO member states, graphic artist Allen Hsu created a banner that is a hybrid of the Chinese flag and the WHO. Like the flag of China, it includes the colors red and yellow, but in this case, instead of five yellow stars, it has a yellow Chinese yuan symbol.

The Chinese yuan also takes the place of the pole that a serpent slithers on in the WHO logo. Also in the logo is a map of China, instead of a map of the globe.

Hsu posted the illustration in the Taiwan section of the social media site Reddit on Wednesday (May 20), a day after the WHA meeting to discuss Taiwan's participation had concluded. In the heading for the post Hsu wrote, ""WHO sides with China to exclude Taiwan, so I made this.""

The WHO's new crimson banner soon gained 779 upvotes and 59 comments on Reddit. Hsu said that he enjoys creating what he calls ""offensive flags,"" more examples of which can be seen on the website Future Travel.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3938738

05/22/2020,"By Kay Liu, CNA staff writerThe global COVID-19 pandemic has upended people's lives, giving terms such as stay at home, work from home, and social distancing added resonance and accentuating the importance of the internet in connecting with others and doing one's job.What many are wondering is if these lifestyle changes will become entrenched and workplaces permanently altered even as the pandemic eases and people can move freely again.Kenny Huang, the chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC), says the trends are here to stay, and he foresees a world of ""internet for everything,"" in which even more tasks will be done online.""Before the pandemic, the internet was an information technology tool. For businesses, it was used to help with operations, marketing or other areas. But in the post-COVID-19 era, all business activities will likely be connected to the internet,"" Huang said in a recent interview with CNA.Huang is in as good a position as anybody to look into the future of cyberspace.His TWNIC, which manages domain names ending with .tw and internet protocol (IP) addresses in Taiwan, routinely conducts surveys and issues reports on internet use that offer insights into trends and developments in the online world and help businesses make decisions.He believes COVID-19 has already made the internet part of a new reality because people no longer feel that things have to be done face-to-face, at least judging by the surge in online traffic and bandwidth he has observed from Dec. 30, 2019 to March 23.Huang estimates that the internet is used in about 10 percent of everyday work at present, but he expects that to go much higher in the future as habits change.Possible risksThe increasingly internet-dependent world that Huang envisions could have a downside, however, with risks that already exist such as threats to cybersecurity or the monopolization of information potentially magnified, he said.He pointed to the possibility of a wider spread of disinformation if people become more reliant on digital media as a news source.""There are always new solutions, but there will always be new types of disruptions,"" said Huang, who used the example of fake news evolving from pure fiction to mixing in some facts to create misinformation.The new solutions, he said, are the likes of the review mechanism introduced by Facebook and Twitter and the work of organizations such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center.Social mediaSocial media could also fall prey to the growing importance of the internet, Huang suggested.At its core, the internet is about transmitting data and connecting devices, while social media plays the role of ""connecting people, who share and exchange the knowledge and views they have,"" he said.Interactions online may mirror those in the real world, but they are not perfect reflections, he said.They could become even more imperfect as reliance on the internet means users gravitate to only a few major service providers, and those platforms' user agreement and rules become, in effect, the rules of society, Huang cautioned.According to the center's annual Taiwan Internet Report for 2019, 79.2 percent of those surveyed between September and November last year used online social media, of whom 98.9 percent used Facebook, 38.8 percent used Instagram and only 5.6 percent used Twitter.Security concernsBehind the changing of habits seen during the global pandemic, the introduction of fifth generation wireless technology (5G) could also profoundly affect user habits by offering accessible, fast internet access at an affordable price.But its arrival has posed a challenge to Taiwan's government that may dominate the debate over cyberspace in the post-COVID-19 world -- balancing an open ecosystem with security concerns.In terms of 5G, the existing internet environment could make it easy for just a few companies to become dominant players, and they may be foreign and even hostile to Taiwan's interests. That has led Taiwan's government to intervene in the 5G arena by banning the use of essential equipment from certain suppliers or countries, especially China, on the grounds of national security, Huang said.Such fears have extended into other areas, including to internet services, he said, citing the example of China-based video-conferencing service Zoom, which has soared in popularity during the pandemic but was banned in Taiwan for government and school use over security concerns.Yet the government has not been as interventionist in other social or commercial domains, Huang said, citing the example of the growing popularity of foreign online streaming services that are full of content from China.The TWNIC report found that 84.5 percent of those surveyed watched online video or streamed content, 76.3 percent of which was produced in Taiwan, followed by China (42.2 percent), the United States (38.2 percent), Japan (35.2 percent), South Korea (34.4 percent) and Europe (13.2 percent).Striking a balance between free speech and China's attempts to use cultural power to spread its message in Taiwan will not be easy for the government, Huang said.Personal protectionMeanwhile, Huang warned that we all, at some level, will have to be prepared for the pitfalls of being heavily reliant on the online world.Shutdowns of service ""have happened and could still happen, and the impact on us will only increase because the time we spend and our reliance on internet services is growing,"" he said.""When using online services, people need to think ahead and have a plan B in case a company shuts down operations. Everyone should back up data routinely, update online accounts, update passwords, and not allow cookies when browsing online when they are not necessary,"" he advised.Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/sci-tech/202005220009
05/22/2020,"Banning Taiwan and its journalists

By David Kilgour, Susan Korah and Robert Henderson





The World Health Assembly (WHA) held its annual meeting this week; Taiwan was still not represented. Its journalists were also barred from covering the online-only proceedings, despite the nation’s clearly demonstrated pandemic expertise that has set an example for the world.

When the SARS epidemic reached Taiwan from southern China in 2003, dozens of lives were lost, but its health experts learned the importance of general testing, masks, technology to locate infected persons, swift decisions and quarantines. The lessons were applied immediately across Taiwan when COVID-19 arrived this year.

From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan participated as an observer in the assembly under the name “Chinese Taipei” when the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) held the presidency. Since 2016, when President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and her Democratic Progressive Party won the national elections, Beijing has regrettably managed to persuade the WHO not to invite Taiwan.

If the WHO and its members had adapted Taiwan’s practices in confronting COVID-19 early this year, including ignoring outbreak denials from Beijing and imposing timely bans on flights from Wuhan and later from all of China, many of the 4.6 million confirmed cases and 312,381 deaths worldwide as of Sunday could have been avoided, along with much economic hardship.

The 27 EU nations, Australia and the US are quite reasonably now demanding an independent investigation of the WHO’s complicity with Beijing.

German intelligence reported recently that China’s president pressured the WHO director-general to delay issuing a global warning about COVID-19 in January. The CIA and the US Department of Homeland Security concluded that Beijing suppressed information about the outbreak so it could buy up medical supplies around the world. The University of Southhampton concluded in its study that 95 percent of the infections could have been avoided if Beijing had acted three weeks earlier.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) recently cited a secret memorandum signed between Beijing and the WHO in 2005 as directly impacting Taiwan’s participation at the annual WHA and related WHO events.

As a result of the agreement, Taipei would require an additional international push to attend the WHA, Wu told lawmakers in Taipei. Despite growing support (including Canada), he predicted correctly that it would be “extremely difficult” for Taiwan to secure an invitation to this year’s virtual meeting.

The agreement’s contents were never made public, but details obtained by Taipei in 2007 stipulate that Taiwan must apply for WHO technical assistance through China and that all exchanges between Taiwan and the WHO must be approved by Beijing.

In a related development, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) called attention to the WHO ban on Taiwanese journalists, denying them the right to cover meetings and press conferences of the global healthcare system, including the WHA. RSF has publicly noted that the reason for the WHO’s ban on Taiwan’s journalists is its refusal to acknowledge Taiwan and its passport due to political pressure from China.

“Denying Taiwanese journalists’ access to WHO and UN activities is a flagrant violation of the right to seek and receive information that is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” said Cedric Alviani, head of RSF’s East Asia bureau.

In contrast to the Chinese Communist Party — which hides the truth and punishes whistle-blowers — Taiwan has demonstrated the importance of transparency and the role of a free media. Taiwan ranked 43rd out of 180 nations in RSF’s world press freedom rankings for this year, while China was 177th.

Denying Taiwanese journalists’ access to WHO meetings is even more ironic following UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ statement on World Press Freedom Day: “Journalists provide an antidote to COVID-19 misinformation.”

In light of the ideals of media freedom expressed by Guterres, it is inexcusable that Taiwan’s journalists are still denied access to international meetings of a UN agency.

Equally objectionable is the ongoing lockdown by the WHO on advice and expertise about COVID-19 from the democratic nation that contained it much better than most of the 193 WHO member states.

They noted that the increasing departures started in 2014 with the Yellow Umbrella Movement seeking greater democracy, and became even more obvious in the anti-extradition protests last year.In addition to growing worries about the political climate in Hong Kong, the scholars said that an increasing number of people there have become less happy with their lives, in particular the skyrocketing property prices.They said the dissatisfaction is expected to increase, in particular after China submitted a draft resolution to its rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), earlier this week to tighten its control on Hong Kong, citing national security concerns, which has raised fears that a ""one country, two systems"" formula promised by the Chinese authorities will become a ""one country, one system"" model.A vote is scheduled to be cast on the resolution at the NPC next week.(By Wang Cheng-chung and Frances Huang) Enditem/J",https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202005230015

During a press conference for the third plenary session of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing, Chinese media asked Wang if China was worried Taiwan-related issues would have a further negative impact on Sino-U.S. relations given that Taiwan-U.S. ties have improved substantially, CNA reported. Wang reiterated the “one China principle,"" adding that the Chinese government and World Health Organization (WHO) have made proper arrangements for the “Taiwan area” to participate in global health affairs.

He stated that Taiwan had shared information on Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic prevention with the WHO and its members. Wang assured that channels for cooperation and professional exchanges are completely unobstructed and denied that there had ever been technical hindrances or gaps in epidemic prevention.

In response to Wang’s comments, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued a press release declaring that Taiwan is a recognized democratic country. It also stressed that only the people of Taiwan have the right to decide their future and that only Taiwan’s elected government has the right to represent the Taiwanese.

MOFA further stated that China has no right to make such ""irresponsible remarks.""

The Chinese government wants to impose “unification” on Taiwan regardless of the wishes of the nation’s citizens, MOFA expressed. The ministry went on to say that this only serves to highlight Beijing’s contempt for public opinion, hostility toward democracy, and incompatibility with democratic countries.

MOFA also pointed out that President Tsai Ing-wen's (蔡英文) inauguration speech on May 20 emphasized Taiwan’s adherence to the principles of “peace, reciprocity, freedom, and democracy” in cross-strait exchanges and promotion of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

Taiwan rejects Beijing's “one country, two systems,” which would downplay Taiwan’s political status and undermine the status quo, the ministry declared.

The NIA in 2019 denied a total of 3,742 entry applications made by Chinese nationals who were found to be associated either with the CPC, its military, administrative, or political bodies, an NIA official told CNA.

The number represents a 7.18 percent in denial rate among 52,144 applications in 2019, which represents a 72 percent increase in rejection rate, or 1,567 more rejections, compared with the number in 2018, according to the NIA official.

Without elaborating on the reasons for the rejections, the official said that beefing up the entry application screening is designed to prevent Chinese nationals from visiting Taiwan for the purpose of infiltrating the country.

According to Taiwan's law, all Chinese nationals who wish to visit Taiwan have to apply for an entry permit to the NIA.

For national security reasons, the NIA has for years been working with the National Security Bureau and the Mainland Affairs Council to screen such applications by Chinese people who are associated with the CPC, the Chinese government or its military, according to the official.

For those who are granted permission to visit Taiwan, the NIA official said the agency will also send agents to interview them during their time in the country to make sure they are not undertaking any work that is inconsistent with the purpose of their visit.

Saturday (May 24) marked the first anniversary of Taiwan's legalization of same-sex marriage. Over 4,000 couples have already registered for marriage licenses in the country.

Despite this, prejudice against the LGBT community still lingers, Equallove said. One recent survey shows around 30 percent of Taiwanese consider homosexuality unacceptable — a view more common among those over the age of 35.

Equallove hopes to focus its energy on legislation, political participation, sociological studies, and cooperation with other sexual minority rights groups in Asia to help bring about true equality in the region. The group will urge the passage of laws related to Taiwanese same-sex couples' rights to adoption, assisted reproduction, and marriage with foreign nationals whose countries do not grant same-sex marriage rights to their citizens.

To amplify the influence of the LGBT community in politics, Equallove plans to establish a network of local legislators who support gender equality while also launching workshops to encourage more sexual minorities to become politicians.

As Taiwan was the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, Equallove has expressed an interest in sharing Taiwan's experience with LGBT groups elsewhere on the continent, such as Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Thailand.

She also said that the 8 million masks to be requisitioned per day are reasonable considering the government currently has between 200 to 300 million masks stockpiled.

Wang also mentioned that Taiwan's daily production capacity of 20 million masks is currently possible due to help from the national army. Once they return back to their original duties, production capacity is expected to decline, unless manufacturers hire more workers.

According to Wang, many mask manufacturers already have foreign orders for Taiwan made masks. She said that all the official documents for lifting the export ban are ready and will be issued once the CECC gives its final approval.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3940506
05/25/2020,"Taipei, May 25 (CNA) Taiwan's manufacturing sector was still feeling the pinch of the global COVID-19 pandemic in April, as an index gauging sentiment among manufacturers fell to its lowest level in 11 years, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) said Monday.The April composite index on manufacturing sector sentiment fell 0.8 points from a month earlier to 81.75, the lowest level since January 2009, when the index stood at 70.99.If there was a bright spot, it was that the month-on-month fall in the April index of 0.8 points was less steep than the 6.28-point plunge in March, likely because of optimism that the reopening of economies around the world will boost demand, the think tank said.Gordon Sun (孫明德), director of TIER's Economic Forecasting Center, said the index may have bottomed out in April because Taiwan's manufacturing sector has shown signs of stabilizing.Meanwhile, in a TIER survey conducted in April, 24.8 percent of manufacturers thought their business would improve over the next six months, up from 18.1 percent in a similar poll conducted in March, while 34.9 percent of them said their business would get worse over the next six months, down from 40.5 percent in the March survey.The survey also found, however, that 21.7 percent of respondents said their business improved in April from a month earlier, down from 27.2 percent in the March poll, and 54.3 percent said business got worse, up from 35.3 percent in the March poll, the TIER said.Meanwhile, the composite index to gauge business sentiment in the local construction industry also fell 1.43 points in April from a month earlier to 84.36, hurt by the weakening of economic activity due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the TIER said.But with the spread of the virus seemingly contained in Taiwan and the low interest rate environment well entrenched, property developers were more optimistic about their business prospects over the next six months, the TIER said.As for the service sector, the composite index rose 0.4 from a month earlier to 82.37 in April as rules governing social activities were gradually eased and the government launched stimulus measures to boost consumption, the TIER said.(By Pan Tsu-yu and Frances Huang) Enditem/ls",https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202005250016
